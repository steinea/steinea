With an undergraduate degree in English literature and a master's degree in humanities, I approach my scholarly work through phenomenological, hermeneutic, and deconstructive methods, leveraging the rich interpretive toolsets of these traditions for the analysis and critique of contemporary interactive media artifacts. I have written extensively on games such as *Dark Souls*, *The Last of Us*, and *Kentucky Route Zero*, with special focus on the intersection of narrative and gaming therein. I also have a strong interest in tabletop roleplaying games, and have conducted research on tabletop games like *Dream Askew / Dream Apart* and *Trophy Dark*. I have presented my research at conferences like the Canadian Game Studies Association conference, the International Conference on Games and Narrative, and the Southwest Popular and American Culture Association conference.
