<p>This is the human-readable sitemap of my root-level pages. My not-so-human-readable <code>sitemap.xml</code> can be found at <a href="/sitemap.xml">/sitemap.xml</a>, and is generated by the <code>jekyll-sitemap</code> <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plugin</a>. As per <a href="https://sitemaps.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sitemaps.org</a>, a sitemap is an “easy way for webmasters to inform search engines about pages on their sites that are available for crawling.” Importantly, given the rapid proliferation of AI scrapers, and as recommended by Jay X Peet on <a href="https://x.com/Jay_X_Peet/status/1831437000949559802" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, I have also added a <code>robots.txt</code>, found at <a href="/robots.txt">/robots.txt</a> (which I copied from Jay's at the <a href="https://www.gameuidatabase.com/robots.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game UI Database</a>), to disallow this type of web crawling of my site.</p>
