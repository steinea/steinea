Hello, world! Welcome to my personal site. I'm a game developer, game studies researcher, tabletop game designer, and occasional poet, located in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia. I work and live on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the Stó꞉lō, Mathxwí, Semá:th, and Kwantlen First Nations.
