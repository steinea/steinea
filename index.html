<div id="collections">
  <h2>Collections</h2>

  <p class="explainer">This site is built with the static site generator <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jekyll</a> and the vast majority of content here is organized using Jekyll's native collections functionality. Collections include both <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posts</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pages</a>, all of which are written in Markdown and then rendered in HTML by Jekyll. The permalink for my collections is <a href="/collections/">/collections</a>.</p>

<div id="h-card">
  <h2>H-Card</h2>

    <p class="explainer">This is my h-card. As per the <a href="https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microformats Wiki</a>, “h-card is a simple, open format for publishing people and organisations on the web.” All you need to do to create your own h-card is add a few html tags to your website. You can validate that your h-card is working correctly at <a href="https://indiewebify.me/validate-h-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWebify.me</a>. The permalink for my h-card is <a href="/h-card/">/h-card</a>.</p>

<div id="slashes">
  <h2>Slashes</h2>

    <p class="explainer">As per <a href="https://slashpages.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slash Pages</a>, slash pages are “common pages you can add to your website, usually with a standard, root-level slug like /now, /about, or /uses. They tend to describe the individual behind the site and are distinguishing characteristics of the IndieWeb.” The permalink for my slashes page is <a href="/slashes/">/slashes</a>.</p>

<div id="verify">
  <h2>Verify</h2>

  <p class="explainer">As per Molly White, a <a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/verify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">/verify</a> page serves as “the system of record for [an] online identity.” I own and control the domain <a href="/">steinea.ca</a>; I sign my <a href="https://github.com/steinea/steinea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commits</a> with my <a href="/pgp/">PGP</a> key; and I control the identities listed below. If there is an identity that claims to be me that is not on this list, check with one of my verified identities on another platform first before connecting with the unclaimed identity. The permalink for my verify page is <a href="/verify/">/verify</a>.</p>

<div id="buttons">
  <h2>Button Garden</h2>
