From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength_(game)):

> [The original analog version of] Wavelength is a party game designed by Alex Hague, Justin Vickers, and Wolfgang Warsch and published in 2019 by CMYK following a successful Kickstarter campaign. Two teams compete to earn points over multiple rounds by guessing the locations of a hidden target on a custom device based on clues relating to a chosen scale given by a player called the "Psychic."
