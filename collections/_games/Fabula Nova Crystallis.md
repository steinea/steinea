From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabula_Nova_Crystallis_Final_Fantasy):

> Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy[c][d] is a series of games within the Final Fantasy video game franchise. It was primarily developed by series creator and developer Square Enix, which also acted as publisher for all titles. While featuring various worlds and different characters, each Fabula Nova Crystallis game is ultimately based on and expands upon a common mythos focusing on important crystals tied to deities. The level of connection to the mythos varies between each title, with each development team given the freedom to adapt the mythos to fit the context of a game's story.
