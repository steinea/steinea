The d’Aboville system is a descending [genealogical numbering system](/genealogical-numbering-system/), as opposed to the ascending Sosa system, that traces family lines from a fixed ancestral point. Though less flexible than Sosa numbering, the d’Aboville system allows for the recording of all ancestors in a family, not just those in a direct line to a contemporary root. This is useful for going wide in a family’s history, whereas an ahnentafel is especially fit for going deep. The d’Aboville system is preferable to the similar Henry system for its legibility, and for the ease with which it handles families with ten or more children.

The d’Aboville groupings recorded on this site are structured around the root’s [seize quartiers](/seize-quartiers/), or sixteen great-great-grandparents, and their ancestors of the same family line. While traditionally used as a proof of nobility, these quartiers consist of farmers, and miners, and servants, and administrators, with no [quarters of nobility](/quarters-of-nobility/) to be found.
