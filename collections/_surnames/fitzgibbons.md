Most likely from Edward MacLysaght's [*Irish Families: Their Names, Arms, and Origins*](https://www.irishacademicpress.ie/product/the-surnames-of-ireland-6th-edition/) (Irish Academic Press, 1991):

> Fitzgibbon, Gibbons. In treating of the surname Gibbons, in Ireland, it must first be mentioned that this is a very common indigenous name in England, and in the course of the several plantations of English settlers in this country from 1600 onwards, as well as a result of business infiltration, it is inevitable that at least a small proportion of our Gibbonses must be of English stock. Having said that we may dismiss this element in the population and consider native Irish families bearing the name.
>
> Strictly speaking there are no native Irish families of Gibbons, if by Irish we mean Gaelic Irish. Our Gibbonses are Norman in origin but are now as completely Irish as any of Gaelic stock. Their origin is twofold, each quite distinct, having nothing in common beyond the fact that their descent was Norman Irish not Gaelic Irish. The Gibbons families of the present day are to be found concentrated in the very parts of the country in which they originated.
>
> The head of this family in Co. Limerick was known as The White Knight being one of the three hereditary knights in Desmond, unique among British and Irish titles - the other two being the Knight of Kerry and the Knight of Glin who are Fitzgeralds. Their territory prior to the upheaval of the seventeenth century was the south-eastern corner of Co. Limerick near Co. Cork. One of the Fitzgibbons (MacGibbon) was chief of Clangibbon in Co. Cork.
>
> John Gibbons (d. 1808), a Mayo landowner, took part in the 1798 Rising; was captured, outlawed and escaped to France. His son John was hanged at Westport in 1798, and another son, Edmund (d.1809), of the Irish Legion, died of wounds. In 1691, Thomas Gibbons, of Mayo, was also a notable outlaw.
>
> From the same stock came Cardinal James Gibbons (1834-1921), Archbishop of Baltimore, whose life work was in America.
>
> The best known of the Fitzgibbons was John Fitzgibbon (1749-1802), Lord Chancellor of Ireland, whose pro-English activity at the time of the Union made him hated in his own day and his memory reviled since.
>
> Two Gerald Fitzgibbons, father and son (1793-1882 and 1837-1909), were outstanding members of the Irish Bar, while Edward Fitzgibbon (1803-1857) wrote several standard works on subjects connected with fishing.
