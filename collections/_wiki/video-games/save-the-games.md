"This symposium held at The Strong, in Rochester, New York, is meant to advance the field of video game preservation. Featuring information sessions, networking opportunities, and tours of museum collections, this gathering will bring together international leaders in video game preservation. The purpose of the symposium is not only to share knowledge but also to cultivate relationships among key contributors in game preservation in order to further the collective work of preserving our digital play heritage. The symposium will immediately follow and be organized in conjunction with the Replaying Japan conference being held in nearby Buffalo, New York, from August 19â€“21."
