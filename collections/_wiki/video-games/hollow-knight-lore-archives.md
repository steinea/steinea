"The archives for Hollow Knight lore documents is a collection of documents written by the community on various lore topics. The goal of the archives is not to put an end to debates but to inform and support discussions.

Though the documents in the archives have gone through an evaluation, it does not guarantee them as being better or more valid than all other theories not present in this archive."
