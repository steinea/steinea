"Reducing the burden of sustainability reporting and compliance

The SGA standard is designed by and for game companies to streamline and improve the quality of sustainability reporting while reducing costs

The SGA Standard reduces the burden and complexity of complying with environmental, social, and governance disclosures required by several jurisdictions worldwide. The initial focus is on meeting the requirements of the European Unionâ€™s  Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards. Starting with the environmental impact, the standard will address all other required topics one by one."
