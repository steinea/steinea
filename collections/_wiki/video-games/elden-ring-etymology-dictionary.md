"English and Japanese names are listed for clarity and convenience. As some of the names come from George R. R. Martin (i.e. the demigods), it can occasionally be ambiguous which language a name is meant to be taken in foremostly. When transliterating Japanese katakana to romaji, 'R' and 'L', as well as 'B' and 'V', are generally interchangeable. For example, ローレッタ can be read as both ‘Lōretta’ and ‘Rōletta’,  and セルブス can be read as ‘Serubusu’ and ‘Seluvusu.’ ス (su) is also often rendered as 'th.' Due to George R. R. Martin creating the primary demigod characters, I will favour the localisation for certain names.

Characters and areas with two names have been broken down into individual entries in order to mitigate confusion and keep entries shorter, e.g. ‘Kenneth’ and ‘Haight’ are individual entries."
