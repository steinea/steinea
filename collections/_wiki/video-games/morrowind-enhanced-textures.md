"MET is the most ambitious upscale project for Morrowind, working with cutting edge technology to give new life to the game's visuals. In 2018 there was very few ways to give an image a higher resolution, but when a new type of upscaler called ESRGANï»¿ was released, that changed. Since then both the technology and our technique has grown considerably.

With new and custom models the textures are upscaled up to 16x their original size, although most at the default 4x, all suited to balance performance and visuals. Numerous bugs have been fixed from the previous release and the vanilla assets, including expansion conflicts, artifacts and bad compression."
