"Explore our annual festival with up to 500 other ghosts! Every October, our countryside village is illuminated by hundreds of jack-o-lanterns carved by your fellow spectres. The cool autumn breeze will soon become the cold wind of winter, so enjoy the haunting season while it lasts!

* Carve a digital pumpkin (without all the mess of carving a real one!)
* Find the perfect spot for your pumpkin at the festival, and win prize ribbons from the other ghosts!
* Run into strangers and make friends! Create silly chat messages by combining words from templates.
* Explore a variety of attractions and collect pins to commemorate your discoveries.
* NEW THIS YEAR: Investigate an escape-room style manor with tricky puzzles. Expect roughly two hours of puzzling!"
