"A graphics improvement add-on to the Morrowind engine, for longer viewing distances, great sunsets, fine shaders and better lighting. Supports MWSE 2.1, included as part of the installer, so that the newest Lua gameplay mods work straight away. As an engine mod, this is not compatible with OpenMW."
