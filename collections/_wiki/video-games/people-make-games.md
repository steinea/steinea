"People Make Games only exists because of folks just like YOU, our patrons. We’re so proud to be funded this way, relying on the people who enjoy our work and want to see us make even more of it. It’s this very setup that has allowed us to spend months investigating the controversy surrounding Disco Elysium, or shine a spotlight on Valve's questionable relationship with unofficial gambling. Since PMG first launched, your support has enabled our reporting to punch well above its weight. We might only be a three-person team, working out of spare bedrooms and cramped offices, but that hasn’t stopped us from breaking some big stories over the years!"
