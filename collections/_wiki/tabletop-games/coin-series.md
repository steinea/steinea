"This series features Volko Ruhnke's game system presenting guerrilla warfare, asymmetric warfare, and COunterINsurgencies around the world - in both historical and contemporary conflicts.

We get a lot of questions from players new to the COIN series about which series game is best suited to new players. We'd suggest you start with Cuba Libre, as it is the least complex in terms of systems, rules overhead, and game size/length. That will teach you the basics of the COIN system. After that, pick another COIN topic you're interested in and move on to that game."

"Some interesting comments in that thread, including a mention of Root and COIN games."

"for some reason that term is popping up more often. But they're wargames! (Made by GMT). Can't tell you if they're fun. But they're very crunchy I hear! ROOT is kinda heralded as a consumer friendly COIN game."
