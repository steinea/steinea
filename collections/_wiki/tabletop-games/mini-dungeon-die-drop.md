"Working on a minidugeon [*sic*] die drop procedure for the UL framework

Roll 6d6

die face: rooms

doubles/triples: larger room

even-even: door

odd-odd door

even-odd: secret passage/locked door

1 Trap/Complication

3/4 Entrance

6 Relic/Treasure

Highest die: where the boss is

Introducing dice of different color you can key a color to a specific thing that needs to be there. In this case yellow is where the MOFO(Boss) is

But could be something else"
