"*Hvid Død* (*White Death*) is a black-box larp focusing on non-verbal physical play. It portrays an allegorical story of settlers trying to set up a community, but breaking apart and dying one by one. The play uses physical restrictions and symbolic props as a central mechanics, as well as a theatric lighting and a thematic soundscape. *Hvit Død* was the first larp in the Nordic tradition where the players are not allowed to talk at all. At the same time, the scenario sticks to a set, stylized story where the players explore the details. *Hvit Død* has been influential to larps such as *I know you are but who am I?*, *The Heist*, *Inside myself outside myself*, and *Beginning*."
