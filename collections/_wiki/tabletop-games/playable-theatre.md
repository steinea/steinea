"Playable theatre broadly describes participatory, immersive theatrical events— embodied experiences where audiences have meaningful agency to influence the outcome— that bring together aspects of games and theatre to create new forms of art and entertainment. These works encompass a wide range of genres in which participants are an active part of the experience, ranging from forms of immersive theatre to live action roleplaying."
