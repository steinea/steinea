"Inspired by the impact of chance in everyday life, BalletCollective, an experimental dance group in New York City, collaborated with Sam Leigh (Anamnesis), an award-winning tabletop roleplaying game designer, to create a totally new and unique expression of the medium: a ballet inspired by a TTRPG. The game that inspired this ballet, *The World We Left Behind*, is available for free. Itâ€™s about explorers making multiple journeys to a deserted planet in order to understand what was left behind and why. You play in four arcs with a deck of playing cards. Sessions of game play inspired the movements and narratives, 'musical, structural, and choreographic,' seen on stage this week."
