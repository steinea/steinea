"A cataloged archive of different resources to demystify the steps that go into creating, publishing, and selling ttrpg products.

Curated by Goblin Archives, this siteâ€™s goal is to lower the barrier of entry for designers. It brings together twitter threads, blogs and youtube videos.

Cataloging these resources aims to demystify the design process. The push to open practice helps support the community. The Archives is a place that makes these practices easy to find."
