#### Biography

*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]].*

Joseph Handford Bowland, son of [[(58) Thomas James Bowland]] and [[(59) Catherine Anderson]] and heir to the Jeffries Corner, Sussex, New Brunswick farm, was born February 28, 1873.

He was married to Margaret Augusta Armstrong, known as Aunt Gussie, born in 1891.

It is Uncle Joe and Aunt Gussie’s farm where the children of Joe’s sister Mary spent the summer. I feel that the best times of my father Fred’s childhood were spent on that farm and then when it was time to return to Saint John for school, it was Uncle Joe and Aunt Gussie that outfitted them in new clothes including shoes.

Joe died December 21, 1968. After a service was held at St. Mark’s Anglican Church, he was buried at Trinity Cemetery in Sussex, New Brunswick.

His wife lived until 1974.
