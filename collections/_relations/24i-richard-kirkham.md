#### Biography

*As told by niece [(12i) Clara Mary Kirkham](/12i-clary-mary-kirkham/), nephews, and [(6) Albert Kirkham](/6-albert-kirkham/), as well as from correspondence with Cousin Dick, and written by Bert’s wife [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

Richard Kirkham was the first child born to [(24) Richard Kirkham](/24-richard-kirkham/) and [(25) Mary Stevens](/25-mary-stevens/) when they were living at his grandfather’s home on Church Street, Princes End, Tipton (Coseley), Staffordshire, England, April 26, 1888.  Eldest son Richard was not a healthy boy and was sent off to school to be educated while his younger brother [(12) Alfred Kirkham](/12-alfred-kirkham/)’s education was shortened so that he could work in the family business brewing the beer.  Once Richard’s education was completed, he returned to manage the wharf end of the business and delivered coal with a horse pulling a cart.

Richard Kirkham and Jane Mallen (Jen) were courting when on February 21, 1911, Richard’s mother Mary died of influenza.  This left a house of men, their father, sons Richard and Alfred with sister [(24iii) Lilian Kirkham](/24iii-lilian-kirkham/) only twelve years old. Richard and Jane were married on July 3, 1911.  Their son Richard (Dickie) was born July 3, 1912, on their first wedding anniversary day.

Everything fell apart once Mary was gone as she had held the business together. When brother Alfred advised the family he was emigrating to Canada, Richard decided his family would move too.

Uncle Dick, Aunt Jen and baby Dickie (Richard 'Cousin Dick' Kirkham), came to Canada in 1913 with widowed Richard (Gramp), brother Alfred (Dad/Grandpa) and sister Lilian (Aunt Lil).  Aunt Jen made a friend on the journey to Canada and when the friend got off the train in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Aunt Jen said, “see you in church on Sunday.” This was a joke for years, but at the time, coming from England she had no idea of distance in her new country.

Uncle Dick worked with Mr. Spurier, in a music store on the corner of Wallace Street, across from Sparks, in Nanaimo.  The merchandise in the store was gramophones, pianos and other things.  For years after Dick’s death on January 10, 1922 of Bright’s Disease, “Kirkham and Spurier” remained painted on the side of the building of the music store.  Richard (Uncle Dick) Kirkham is buried in the Nanaimo Cemetery, Range 22, Plot 41 off Bowen Road.

Sister Lilian (Aunt Lil) was living with Richard and Jane (Aunt Jen) when Richard died.  Lil, a “Flapper”, bringing home young fellows, introduced to Aunt Jen one fellow from Scotland named Alex Fowler.  It was Aunt Jen who married him. Younger than she was, Alex was a professional soccer player in Scotland - nickname “Glummie”.  When he got out of soccer, he worked in the mines in Cumberland, Courtney/Comox.

Aunt Jen, Alex and cousin Dick went back to England in 1933 returning to Vancouver Island in 1935.  In England, Alex worked for Austin Morris Motor Company. Cousin Dick worked for Bean Industries.  It was Bean Cars before World War I.  He ran the big lathe turning out joints for Iraq Pipeline which stretched across the desert to a boat harbour where oil tankers were loaded.

Aunt Jen’s sister Mary, married to Jack Fellows, had shared split accommodation at 224 Prideaux Street in Nanaimo with Alfred’s family. From Nanaimo, they moved to Cumberland when Jack found work there mining. They went back to England in June 1934.

Jack’s father had been the games keeper for the Earl of Neufield in Staffordshire, but Jack found work in the coal mines, work he was familiar with in Canada. Aunt Jen also had a sister Gertrude married to Jack Taylor and they lived in the Comox/Courtney area.  Their daughter Muriel continued to live in the area until her passing April 20th, 2001.

Alex worked as gantry on the rail bed of a logging firm in Courtney. Cousin Dick ran the speeder taking crews in and out of Camp 5 for Bloedel, Stewart and Welch. Later, also in Courtney, he repaired upholstery, etc. in old cars for Corfield Motors.

Aunt Jen, born December 30, 1885, died April 8, 1977 at 91 years of age. Alex, born August 24, 1898, died on February 5, 1981 at 82 years of age.
