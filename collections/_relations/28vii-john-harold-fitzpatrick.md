#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-h-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

John Harold was the third son, seventh living child, born to [(28) John Thomas Fitzpatrick](/28-john-thomas-fitzpatrick/) and [(29) Mary Elizabeth Bowland](/29-mary-elizabeth-bowland/), on August 30th, 1912, in Saint John, New Brunswick.

As a small child, Harold saw his older siblings leave Saint John for Calgary, Alberta, starting in 1919, when [(28i) Jessie Maitland Fitzpatrick](/28i-jessie-maitland-fitzpatrick/) and Frank left by train. [(28ii) Annie Catherine Fitzpatrick](/28ii-annie-catherine-fitzpatrick/), [(14) Frederick Francis Fitzpatrick](/14-frederick-francis-fitzpatrick/), and [(28v) Gordon William Fitzpatrick](/28v-gordon-william-fitzpatrick/) would follow. Sister [(28iii) Mary Muriel Fitzpatrick](/28iii-mary-muriel-fitzpatrick/) died in 1921. Harold with his parents and sister [(28viii) Audrey Heloise Fitzpatrick](/28viii-audrey-heloise-fitzpatrick/) also took the train to Calgary in 1923, but their trip was to be a visit with the family. His mother took ill and in 1924 she died. He would remember the ocean but it was Calgary, Alberta, where he grew up living with sister Maitland and her family.

Harold’s first job, at age sixteen, was a butcher. He was a smart dresser, known for his ice cream colored suits. In his early twenties, Harold spent weekends with his brother Fred’s family, singing in the church choir with Fred and sister-in-law Vena.

He was sent to Nelson, B. C. by the Underwood Typewriter Company, to manage their new branch and there met Ruth Evelyn Sindel. They were married in June 6th, 1936.

Harold and Ruth had four daughters---Delores, Marilyn, Gayle and Jacqueline. When Delores and Marilyn were one and two years old, cousin Muriel was old enough to babysit and loved to put pretty dresses on the little girls.

Brother Fred and family lived across the street from Harold and family, on 27th Avenue S. W. in Calgary, which meant the girls grew up playing together with cousin Lorraine. Attending each other’s birthday parties created a wonderful bond and great fun.

The family moved to the district of Killarney when Harold built a new home at 26th Avenue and 26A Street S. W. He paid $40.00 for the lot. Harold had the help of his best friend and confidante, Hillard. They had played football at Riley Park, one of Calgary’s oldest parks. Nephew Everett helped Harold and Hillard hand dig the basement and mix the concrete for the walls.

Cousin Lorraine’s memory visiting the family at the Killarney house is of Gayle, maybe five or seven years old. What an acrobat she was, flying from the back of the sofa across the room always landing upright on her feet. Gayle loved animals and at the age of eighteen she owned three horses and a saddle Harold bought for her at Sears. Names of the horses, that come to mind, were Joker and Spider.

In 1950, the family moved to Lethbridge for a fresh start. Harold had a drinking problem and after many warnings, was let go. He was the best typewriter man in Alberta and it was Billy Fraser, a former employer, who arranged a job for Harold through Calgary Typewriter. The girls remember riding the bus with their mother on Sunday afternoons singing as they toured the city of Lethbridge.

A few years later, with his life under control, Harold moved the family back to Calgary to take up employment with Smith Corona Typewriter Company, hired by friend George Priestnal. Niece Lorraine can remember Uncle Harold coming in to the C.P.R. office to repair her typewriter. She proudly let her fellow workers know that he was her uncle.

Soon after he began to have health problems but enjoyed his growing family and took up fishing. When he wasn’t camped by a stream fishing, Harold was always making improvements to their home in Montgomery.

Harold worked on the house after work. Having built the house in Killarney, the addition of two rooms and a basement on the Montgomery house was still no easy task. He was older and in poor health. By the time he finished the addition, all the girls had moved away.

Harold liked to fish out by Hillard Hetherington’s cabin in Bragg Creek. His friend Hillard’s widow, as of February 1999, is living in Bow View Lodge in Montgomery, now a suburb of Calgary. Harold’s widow Ruth stayed on in the Montgomery home until year 2000. She too is in Bow View Lodge.

Always a happy fellow and of small stature, he was known around Calgary in the typewriter world as “Pee Wee.”

When daughter Marilyn and her husband Don were newlyweds and struggling on articles wages, it was not uncommon for Harold to arrive at their door, towards the end of the month, with a bag of groceries.

After brother Fred retired from the Department of Veteran Affairs, he was caretaker of the Glenbow Foundation (pre-Glenbow Museum days), and Fred and Vena were living in the foundation house. Harold frequently joined Vena and Fred for lunch. In those days, niece Lorraine’s husband Bert was traveling between Vancouver and Calgary working for the Canadian Pacific Railway as secretary on the business car with the Vice-President, Pacific Region, J. N. Fraine. Bert often crossed the railway tracks to join the brothers for lunch.

Harold died rather suddenly May 11th, 1967, at 54 years old. He is buried in Queensland Cemetery, Calgary, Alberta. He was so proud of his daughters and their families. When the grandchildren started to arrive, that was an additional joy. Due to his untimely death, he never saw three of his grandchildren---Marilyn’s Scott and Gayle’s Kenny and Kristy.
