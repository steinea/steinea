#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-h-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

Mary Muriel was the third child and third daughter born to [(28) John Thomas Fitzpatrick](/28-john-thomas-fitzpatrick/) and [(29) Mary Elizabeth Bowland](/29-mary-elizabeth-bowland) on February 4, 1899, in Saint John, New Brunswick.

Muriel, as she was called, worked at a bank. She had married George Bain in 1919. It was in 1921, while at work, she suffered a ruptured appendix. She was rushed to her parent’s home where she died on April 19th, at twenty-two years of age.

It was a great shock to the entire family. Muriel’s sister [(28i) Jessie Maitland Fitzpatrick](/28i-jessie-maitland-fitzpatrick) once said it was such a horror to watch her beautiful sister age before their eyes from the poison that went throughout her system.

Muriel’s mother grieved so much. She visited the gravesite every day and this began to take its toll. John, seeing his wife losing ground herself, suggested to daughter Maitland that perhaps a trip west to Calgary would help her mother.

Mary and John, with eleven year old [(28vii) John Harold Fitzpatrick](/28vii-john-harold-fitzpatrick/) and nine year old [(28viii) Audrey Heloise Fitzpatrick](/28viii-audrey-heloise-fitzpatrick/), took the train to Calgary in 1923. Ironically, Mary never returned to Saint John as she took ill and passed away in Calgary in 1924.
