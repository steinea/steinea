#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-h-lorraine-fitzpatrick/) with help from other family members.*

Lilian was the third child born to [(24) Richard Kirkham](/24-richard-kirkham/) and [(25) Mary Stevens](/25-mary-stevens/) on February 24, 1899, in England.

Her mother died when she was three days away from her twelfth birthday and was buried on Lilian’s birthday. This probably had a great influence on the type of person she became. Initially, there were only men in the family home that being her father and two brothers. It must have been a welcome change for her when older brother Dick married.

When brother Alf announced he would move to Canada, the entire family made the decision to travel with him. They arrived in Canada in 1913 when Lil was fourteen.  Nanaimo, B.C. became her home for the next ten or so years until she married Bob Milne and moved to Vancouver, B.C.

Bob and Lil raised two daughters, Elizabeth, who was known by everyone as Betty, and her sister Shirley. As a family, they visited the Kirkham family in Nanaimo frequently. This gave the cousins many hours of playtime together.

Alfred and Elsie’s children loved to visit Aunt Lil in Vancouver. She was always available to meet the ferry when members of the family came over whether it was just to visit, or to attend the Pacific National Exhibition. In later years, some of the boys boarded at Aunt Lil and Uncle Bob’s when they found work in Vancouver.

Cousin Dick remembers Aunt Lil meeting his family as well. His family also lived on the island and would drive to Nanaimo from Courtney, to catch the ferry.

Lil had many trips late in life when through her daughters’ employment, she was able to travel on Air Canada with a family pass. She visited the family in England touching base with her British roots and enjoyed the sunshine of Hawaii.

Always a keen mind and the life of the party, Lil was considered the one to live in three decades should she reach her 101st birthday.  That was not to be, however, she did live until Jan. 11, 1989.  Bob’s death had predeceased her on May 17, 1972.
