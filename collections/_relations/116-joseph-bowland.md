#### Biography

*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]].*

Great-granddaughters [[(28i) Jessie Maitland Fitzpatrick]] and [[(28ii) Annie Catherine Fitzpatrick]] stated Joseph was well off in Ireland, the owner of a castle. However, they said he lost everything betting at bullfights in Spain. He left Ireland for Scotland where he learned weaving.

From the census records of 1851, Joseph Bowland (Bowlin) arrived in the Colony (Canada) in 1837. There is no record of his wife, only of his nine year old son [[(58) Thomas James Bowland]].

Word of mouth made reference to his wife’s Spanish skin color, passed on through my Grandmother Mary Elizabeth (Bowland) Fitzpatrick and my father. Did he meet and marry his wife while in Spain? Did she die in childbirth or enroute to the Colony?

Upon arrival in the Colony, Joseph was registered as a weaver.

The 1851 census, St. Martins East, St. John’s County, New Brunswick, states Joseph’s occupation as a “mill man”. However, by the time of the 1861 census, Joseph and his son Thomas are farmers in Sussex, New Brunswick. It is on this land, known as Jeffries Corner, where the family lived through four generations.

The book titled [*Irish Emigration and Canadian Settlement: Patterns, Links, and Letters*](https://utorontopress.com/9780802069108/irish-emigration-and-canadian-settlement/) by Cecil J. Houston and William J. Smyth, adds new insight relative to the emigration from Ireland of our ancestors. Attached are excerpts copied from this book, but the following ‘notes’ are highlighted as follows:

> By the 1830’s, emigration had extended from the Ulster core into the northern midlands and north Connaught.[^1] Regional character of emigration from the country extends to their regional arrival in Canada. Trading links between Irish ports and British North American colonies greatly affected the Irish outflow and forged in Canada a set of regions each with their own distinctive Irish regional ingredients.[^2] Dublin was involved with Quebec but not with Saint John, and Liverpool, the largest English port and most accessible to Dublin and the eastern seaboard of Ireland, was also not linked to Saint John. There were practically no English immigrants to Saint John from the 1820’s onward, and the Liverpool-Dublin axis across the Irish Sea, so important in flows of both Irish and English to Quebec, was a minor part of Saint John’s commercial arrangements. The Saint John pattern was much less diverse and its scale more limited than that of the St. Lawrence port and as a consequence, Irish communities created in New Brunswick were less likely to encompass the full heterogeneity of the Irish emigrations than were those in the central Canadian settlements of Upper and Lower Canada.[^3]

> Spinning had been technologically revolutionized becoming the preserve of a few large factories in eastern Ulster and throughout much of the province. Family incomes dropped when the traditional independence of weavers was eliminated. They became piece-workers employed by owners of spinning and bleaching firms. In Ulster, stimulus for emigration was thus more intense.[^4]

As stated above, Joseph worked as a ‘mill man’ in the St. Martins area of New Brunswick, however, once he acquired the funds to purchase land, it is in Sussex, New Brunswick where he and his son put down their roots.

Joseph died July 28, 1888 at 88 years old and is buried in Trinity Cemetery, Sussex, New Brunswick.
