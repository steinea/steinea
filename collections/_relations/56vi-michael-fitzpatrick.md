#### Biography

*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]].*

Michael was the sixth child born to [[(56) William Fitzpatrick]] and [[(57) Mary Fitzgibbons]], on February 10, 1887, in Saint John, New Brunswick.

Unlike his brother [[(56v) Charles Fitzpatrick]], Michael did keep in touch with his family with reference to a letter uncle [[(56vii) Robert A. Fitzpatrick]] wrote to nephew [[(14) Frederick Francis Fitzpatrick]] in 1965. He refers to Mike’s wife and daughter living in Boston, out in Roslindale and that he goes over to see them every Sunday.

Mike was a sign painter for Coca Cola in New York and that is where he died.
