#### Biography

*As written by her daughter-in-law Lorraine with help from her daughters [(12i) Clara Mary Kirkham](/12i-clara-mary-kirkham/) and [(12v) Lilian Kirkham](/12v-lilian-kirkham/), sons [(12) Alfred Kirkham](/12-alfred-kirkham/) and [(6) Albert Kirkham](/6-albert-kirkham/), as well as, her nephew Bernard Holland, nephew Jack Holland’s wife Mabel, cousin Frank North’s daughter Camille House and cousin Gladys North’s daughter Jose Payton.*

[(54) Edwin John Baker](/54-edwin-john-baker/), born July 23, 1841, in Worcester, England, on June 6, 1865, married [(55) Elizabeth Hall](/55-elizabeth-hall/), born December 21, 1841, in Sedgley, Staffordshire, England.

Second cousin Jose Payton, granddaughter of Alice Baker, wrote in December 2001 as follows: “They operated a pub along the canal for the barges. Elizabeth had to go to Daisy Bank Bradley to get off the canal to do her shopping. She was very small. When she grew older, she had lovely silver hair that reached down to her waist. She did her hair in two plates, then did the plates round the back of her head, with lovely combs in her hair.

Elizabeth (Betsy) always wore black. Her dress went down to her ankles and she wore a nice broach at the neck of her dress. She wore a white apron with real lace, black shoes and stockings. She did not have a coat. In the winter she had a lovely thick wool shawl and in the summer she would make her own shawls.

She was two weeks over 98 years of age when she died. The doctor said she was just very tired – worn out. She died August 5, 1939, just before the war. Up until her 98th birthday she went to the pictures three times a week. Three nights she went to the pub for a drink. Sundays she had a drink in. On her 98th birthday, The Express and Star took a four-generation photo with her daughter Clara, Clara’s son Albert and his daughter Elsie. It was on the front page – “the oldest old lady in Bilston.”

She never learned to write. When it was time for her to sign up to receive her old age pension, she marked the papers with an ‘X’.

Her husband Edwin John Baker predeceased her February 10, 1914.

Edwin and Elizabeth had two daughters. [(27) Clara Baker](/27-clara-baker/) was born June 30, 1871, and Alice was born in 1873. Clara learned to play the piano and often played for lodgers staying at the pub.

Clara Baker on December 25, 1886, married [(26) James Henry Holland](/26-james-henry-holland/), born February 4, 1867. They would have three children. Albert Henry Holland was born December 16, 1887, in Dudley, Staffordshire, England. Elsie Holland was born in Cateshill, Staffordshire, England, December 20, 1891. The third child, a daughter, died very young. Elsie said that her father idolized this girl and was upset with the Lord for taking her. Their father, James Henry Holland, one of eighteen children, was a butcher working at Palethorpe's where he made sausage - all hog products. He went to London annually to an agricultural fair with his entry of a roast, chops, sausage, and won a first, second or third prize every time.

When Elsie was a little girl, she eavesdropped on a conversation her mother had with a friend who had dropped in for tea. What was being said was that the minister had killed his wife, not physically, but an expression that meant he had driven her to death with his treatment of her. Of course, little Elsie took it literally and when she was outside she told her playmate. The playmate said 'that's murder'! Elsie wanted her friend to say nothing but from then on the child blackmailed Elsie. What she would say to Elsie was,
'You got any stick? You got any suck? When you get some, give me some.'

If Elsie had no candy for the girl she threatened she would talk. Elsie finally had to tell her mother what was going on. Her mother explained what it all meant and she had no need to fear the girl any longer.

Elsie worked at Buller's, a firm making china doorknobs and such items, earning 3 and 9 pence (approx. $.97) per week. She started work when she was fourteen years old. Her boss, a tyrant, was Mrs. Hatten. One day she went to work after washing her hair. Her hair was thick and that day unmanageable. Her mother had washed her school hat, now a fuzzy mess, and Elsie was not allowed to wear her good hat. She went to work wearing the fuzzy hat and a girl made fun of her telling Elsie she looked awful and shouldn't be working there. Elsie went home angry and bagged some soot from the fireplace to take to work the next day. It took three days before she was alone with the girl but when she was she threw the soot in the girls face. The girl never bothered her again.

 Prior to working, Elsie received spending money from her father but when she went to work, her mother wanted what she earned. When Elsie got a raise she tried to keep it from her mother without success. When she received a double raise, however, Elsie could keep half for herself and the regular raise is all her mother knew about. Always trying to get extra money for herself, when it was optional whether they stayed after work to scrub the floor, Elsie told her mother she would stay that extra hour if the money earned was her own. She did not want to work the extra time if she had to give her pay to her mother. Her mother (Grannie Holland) sounds mean but when Elsie's daughter Clara and Elsie visited England in later years (1956), Clara said she was the sweetest person you would want to know.

Second cousin Camille House, granddaughter of Alice Baker, wrote this year as follows: “Each Sunday as a child, we would go to see Grandma Alice for tea and then walk to Great Aunt Clara’s in Broad Street (69 Broad Street) for a chat. She would always give me some pocket money and would take me through to the back rooms to see the two people living there. She called me Me Me, apparently as a child I could not pronounce my name and Me Me became a nickname. I remember she always wore black and had little specs (glasses) on the end of her nose. She seemed to me to be such a tiny person. I find it good to remember those days. It seems strange that I should now be writing to you knowing that she was your Grandma, Bert. I can remember the room we used to sit in very clearly. The front door opened directly into it. There was a table with a heavy tablecloth on and a dresser with all her bits and pieces on it, and I believe it was a rocking chair Great Aunt Clara sat on. The room was lovely and warm with a little coal fire.

Grannie Holland (Elsie’s mother, Clara (Baker) Holland) lived to 83 years of age.
Elsie’s brother Albert Holland was an engineer. He supervised welding and other metal work. Appliances like an iron were made for department store sales.

Albert with his wife Harriet, had five children. Daughter Elsie never married. She worked at the headquarters of the Workers’ Educational Association in Oxford, England. She had taken a course at Ruskin College in Oxford and remained in Oxford all her working life.

Son Albert, known as Harry, became an engineer and worked in Wolverhampton. Harry found himself in hospital during the Second World War and married his nurse. Elizabeth (Betty) and Harry adopted two children, David and Judith.

Son William John, known as Jack, was a chartered engineer and acted as consultant to many governments in places such as Nigeria, Iran, Rio de Janeiro, etc. As well, he was involved in the big Kariba Dam project in what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwa and Zambia. Jack and his wife Mabel had two sons Peter and Robert and a daughter named Tina.

Son Arthur died as a child.

Daughter Barbara never married. She was a social worker in charge of organizing Home Help for the sick and elderly. She lived with her parents in Bilston, England with brother Harry and his family just down the street in his new home. After parents Albert and Harriet passed away, Barbara and Elsie would live together in the family home until they both died.

Son Bernard became a teacher marrying fellow teacher Margaret. They had two sons named Edward and Stephen. In retirement, Bernard became interested in searching the Holland Family Tree.

He was able to trace the generations back to the marriage of [(208) John Holland](/208-john-holland/) to [(209) Sarah Talbot](/209-sarah-talbot/), June 24, 1790, in Dudley, Staffordshire, England. Their son [(104) James Holland](/104-james-holland/) married [(105) Mary Mills](/105-mary-mills/), November 8, 1827, in Aston, Birmingham. Their son [(52) Elijah Holland](/52-elijah-holland/) married [(53) Elizabeth Ann Edmonds](/53-elizabeth-ann-edmonds/), December 11, 1865, also in Birmingham. Elijah and Elizabeth’s first child was [(26) James Henry Holland](/26-james-henry-holland/) born February 4th, 1867, in Dudley, Staffordshire, England.

Second cousin Jose Payton wrote in her letter of 2001 what her grandmother Alice Baker told her of her grandfather Benjamin North and I quote:

“He was about 6ft. 4 in. tall – big built man – not fat – very straight because he wore a corset for his back. He had bright red hair. Daughter Dora had red hair. Grandma said he left her when their youngest child Frank was about three years old. He had another woman and they went to live in Wales. He had another family with her.

In 1940, when the Midlands was being bombed, he found out where she was. I don’t know how. He wanted to know how she was because of the bombing. She did not reply to his letter. About six months later she had another letter from him asking if he could come and see her but she never answered the letter. What ever happened to him, we will never know.”

Alice owned three cookhouses where meals were cooked and served.

Alice Baker and Benjamin North had three children. Dora born in 1895, died in December of 1966; Gladys born in 1901, died in December of 1978; and Frederick Francis (Frank) born January 16, 1908, died November 20, 1998.

Alice is pictured in the middle row of Elsie and Alfred’s wedding picture. Dora and Gladys are in the front row and Frank is one of the children at the front of the picture. Elsie was always very fond of cousin Frank.

Dora was very clever. She married Alfred Davies, Alfred Kirkham’s close friend. Gladys married Bowen Payton. Francis Frederick (Frank) married Louie Maddocks. From these families descend our greater Holland family.

Below are pictures of Elsie Holland age 10 and again before she married.
