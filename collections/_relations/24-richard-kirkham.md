#### Biography

*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]] based on genealogy researched by [[(12) Alfred Kirkham]]’s second cousin [[Francis Albert 'Billy' Kirkham]] in Suffolk, England, conversations with some of the grandchildren of ‘Gramp.’*

Richard was the sixth child born to Richard Kirkham and Sarah Wherton, on June 4, 1863, in Tipton, Staffordshire, England.  His mother Sarah died when he was five years old.  His father remarried one year later.  Richard never really knew his own mother but said no mother could have been better than his stepmother.

Much of Richard’s life, while he resided in England, “was spent in pursuit of coal with his brother John, who was his senior by ten years.  He was also involved at the same time as an innkeeper.  John and Richard were charter and royalty masters (Earl of Dudley).  Richard and John worked mines in the area of Tipton and Dudley, one of which was situated at the rear of Dudley Guest Hospital.  Others were at Coneygree, Fountain Lane, Bunn’s Lane - Rowley Regis and Deepfields near Bilston, Staffordshire.  They eventually went broke.”[^1]

Richard married Mary Stevens at Christchurch in Coseley, Staffordshire, England, on July 28, 1887.  He was 24; she was 23.  Richard and Mary had three children whom they named Richard, Alfred and Lilian.

“In the year 1900, at the time of the opening ceremony of Victory Park in Tipton, (which was brought into being to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria), Richard kept the hotel in Waterloo Street named “Pear Tree Inn”, and at this time was also a colliery agent dealing with Alfred Hickman, Guest Keen and Nettleford, Tupper of Bradley and others.  The Tipton Harriers, an athletic club, had their quarters behind “The Pear Tree Inn”.  Ian Palethorpe was President.”[^2]   Richard’s son Alfred’s father-in-law, James Henry Holland, worked as a butcher for Palethorpe’s.

Richard later kept “The Waggon and Horses”, a public house, situated on the corner of Dudley Road and High Street in Tipton.  Following this, he purchased “The Black Horse Inn” situated in Park Lane, Tipton.[^3]

Mary seemed to run the business.  Eldest son Richard was not strong so was sent to school for further education.  Son Alfred at age eleven did the brewing of the beer.  In his own public house, a customer would call, “Hey gaffer!  Get me a pint” and Richard would reply, “I don’t serve.  See the Mrs.”  Richard stayed at “The Black Horse Inn” until 1911 when Mary died of influenza.  Mary died February 21, 1911, and was buried on Feb. 24th, the day her daughter Lilian turned twelve years old.

“In the year 1909, Richard, John, John’s son Albert (Billy’s father) and Mr. Goodwin of Goodwin, Foster and Brown (Provision Merchants, Dudley), formed another partnership in a coal venture - such could have been the opening up again of the pit behind the hospital or perhaps that at Bunn’s Lane.  Albert was at the time a commercial traveler for Goodwin, Foster and Brown.  It is know that he was training Mr. Goodwin’s two sons in the method of stocktaking at the various branches of the business.”[^4]  

When Richard’s wife Mary was alive, the family prospered.  She worked far too hard as she was the one that made a go of it.  She ran the pub and the coal business at the wharf was managed by son Richard who delivered coal by horse and buggy, something Alfred did too.  Had Mary lived, the family may have never emigrated to Canada.  Within months of her death, with all of them draining the profits, the business failed.  Mary’s daughter Lilian said “her mother would say her father had to make buckets full to save a cupful”.

“An immigration office was established in Charing Cross Road that was independent of the High Commissioner’s office.  Numbers emigrating to Canada increased.  The largest year of all came in 1912 - 13 when 150,000 Britishers arrived in Canada.  Most settlers from Britain came as individuals in search of a better standard of living and in the hope of escaping the rigidities of the English class structure”. [^5]

In 1913, a Canadian politician named R. B. Bennett (became Prime Minister of Canada, 1930 - 1935) visited Tipton, Staffordshire, England, inviting men to emigrate to Canada, specifically Nanaimo, B. C. where he claimed there was lots of work in the coal mines.  Richard’s son Alfred heard the man and decided he would give it a try.  It was his idea to make the trip alone, however, the entire family made the journey together.  This included Alfred’s widowed father Richard (Gramp), brother Richard and his wife Jane (Aunt Jen) and their baby son Richard (Dickie), sister Lilian and Alfred.  They arrived in Canada on SS Andania August 30th, 1913.  You may notice on the manifest list of passengers on the Andania, note is made regarding Gramp’s blind eye from an accident when he was eight years old.  The manifest list referred to is shown with pictures of his daughter Lilian.

Alfred returned to England in 1915;  Richard (Gramp) in 1920.  Other family members stayed in Canada.

Richard (Gramp) visited his nephew Francis Albert (Billy’s father) at Bell Street, in Tipton, as Richard’s brother John (Uncle Jack) had passed away on January 29, 1919.  Richard was living with his son Alfred, now married (1916) to Elsie.  Billy remembered his visit.  John (Uncle Jack) was Billy’s grandfather.  Billy wrote, I was intrigued by him!  For he had an artificial eye and told me that, when a boy, he tried to untie a knot in his shoelace:  It was by using a fork to do so, which slipped and poked his eye thus losing the sight - he also recited Shakespeare and I believe he was a student of this work.”[^6] The fact is, Richard lost the sight of one eye when he was eleven years old.     

Richard upon his return to England vowed he would never return to Canada.  However, he found that England was only a great place as long as he had money to treat his cronies.  After the money was gone and no one gave him a job, Canada was all he could talk about.  It was post-war England, and for son Alfred, life again was hard, working in the coal mines.  The future in England was not a bright one.  It was determined they should return to Nanaimo - Richard and Alfred, this time with Alfred’s wife Elsie and their children Clara, three and one half years old and Alfie, two years old.  They left England September 30th, 1920 arriving Quebec October 21st, 1920.  It was November before they arrived in Nanaimo on Vancouver Island.  Uncle Dick, working in the piano store in Nanaimo, funded their passage.  They would pay him back once they began working in Canada.

Richard worked at different jobs - whatever came along.  He was Deputy Sheriff to Mr. Crawford at the lagoon at Hammond Bay Road and also at Bowser.  He slept in a tent on location at these jobs.   

When son Alfred and his family lived at 224 Prideaux Street, Richard slept with grandson Alfie when work didn’t provide a place to stay.

It was 1927 when Richard was hired as a night watchman at the Windsor Hotel.  He had this position for about two years.  Room and board did not come with this job.  He moved in with Alfred and Elsie, now living at 151 Prideaux Street.

Doug Porter, clerk at the hotel, after being warned, came to work drunk and was fired.  Richard got Doug Porter’s job and worked the morning shift, seven days a week, room and board provided.  As the family said, “Now he was in clover”!  His grandson Richard (cousin Dick) worked at the hotel as a bell hop.

In 1929, Richard loaned son Alfred $1100.00 to purchase the property at 108 Prideaux Street.  The house with the cottage at the back of the property was a good investment to house the family and he would have separate accommodation for himself.  Alfred and Elsie paid the debt back at $15.00 per month.  Richard knew that at age 70, after a ‘means test’, he would receive an old age pension of $20.00 per month.  The family moved to 108 Prideaux Street in February 1929.

Alec McNeil shared the position of clerk at the hotel with Richard and they both lived at the hotel.  They had an arrangement of working a double shift, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. so that they each had every other Sunday off.  On these Sundays, Richard and friends Bob Hindmarch and Jim Coldwell took drives enjoying fine food and drink in restaurants or beer parlours in Nanaimo and the surrounding countryside.  When he returned home to the cottage from such outings, Richard would lie on the couch and sing hymns until he fell asleep.  He had been in the choir at St. Paul’s Anglican Church for a number of years.  

Richard retired when the hotel was sold.  He was 72 years of age.  Joe Fox was the proprietor of the Windsor Hotel.  As long as he ran the business, it was successful, however, Joe ended up in Essendale where he died.  His brother Jim took over along with sister Maryanne who came out from England to help Jim.  They ran the business into the ground.  Richard made up a rhyme, “Ode Jim Fox, he begged backer when he had some in his box”.   For the uninitiated, ‘backer’ is tobacco.

At 70 years of age, Richard’s blind eye became diseased and started giving him a lot of trouble. Eye doctor, Dr. Emery, advised the eye be removed. He wore a glass eye for awhile but he was too old and felt better going without it.

Richard was a fastidious dresser and liked his boots handmade.

Grandson Alf had a second bout of rheumatic fever when he was 23 or 24 years old.  Richard visited him in the hospital (78 years in 1941).  As Alf recalls, “Gramp was by now

having difficulty with a double hernia and at that time, and at his age, an operation was not advised.  It was quite an effort for him to come to the hospital to visit as he found walking difficult and once there he had to go to the bathroom.  Gramp was quite put out when he returned to my room and said, ‘there’s a chinaman using the toilet’.  Of course, the man was a patient and had  every right to do so.”

Grandsons Bert and Jim spent a lot of time with their Gramp when they were twelve and six years of age.  Prior to a Saturday matinee movie, they would be hinting how much they wanted to go to the movie but they didn’t have enough money.  Gramp would generally get fed up with the charade and come up with the funds needed, but not always!  Sometimes he just told them to “gar-out” (get out).  Guess it depended on how he felt that day.  “Gar-out” was one of his more common expressions, as you could hear him saying it when he was shooing his cat Tableaux (Ta Blow), out of the cottage.

The cottage consisted of a large kitchen, bathroom and two bedrooms with electricity and indoor plumbing.

Once retired and living in the cottage, Richard took care of his own breakfast and did his own cleaning every day, except when he was sick.  Elsie cooked a dinner for him every day.  In Elsie’s busyness, sometimes she would forget to get it down to him.  It may get on for 12:30 p.m. when she would hear his door shaking.  She would quickly realize she had forgotten and get his dinner to him - fast!  He came up to the house every Sunday and had dinner for as long as he could.  If not, it was taken to him in the cottage.  As his appetite waned he'd’say, "I couldn't eat it all Elsie.  I left a bit oh spud”.  For the most part he ate well and to leave a wee bit of potato on the plate was a joke.

His personality was quite pleasant - an all right guy.  Of course, he could be ‘short’ but only when annoyed by the kids or something similar.  He wanted to be looked after and ‘pronto’ but was really very easy with an interest in everything.

Grandson Dick lived in the cottage with Richard until he went to work on the ships.  As Gramp grew older and mobility became a problem, Dick was able to get up during the night to keep the fire lit.  All the grandchildren took turns helping their mother as she did his washing as well as meals.  Granddaughter Clara gave the cottage a good cleaning every so often.

He outlived his friends.  Prior to the end of his life, he was more or less immobile because he had a double hernia that gave him no end of problems.  He spent most of his time reading - Shakespeare.  Sitting on his couch he would quote from Shakespeare, “My offense is rank, it smells to heaven”.

Elsie was good to him and he knew it.  He said, “No one like his Elsie”.

Elsie was sick at the time Richard died.  He felt he should say goodbye to her but he was taken to the hospital, by ambulance during the night, and died at 5:00 a.m. on October 4th, 1946.  He is buried in the Nanaimo Cemetery, Range 51 off Kerr Street, Plot 15.

His grandchildren have been heard to say, “he was a good grandpa to us and we were good to him, but the best was his daughter-in-law, Elsie”.
