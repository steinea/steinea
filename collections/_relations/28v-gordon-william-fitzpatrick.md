#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-h-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

Gordon William was [(28) John Thomas Fitzpatrick](/28-john-thomas-fitzpatrick/) and [(29) Mary Elizabeth Bowland](/29-mary-elizabeth-bowland/)’s second son born October 31, 1904 in Saint John, New Brunswick. He was the ‘dashing’ uncle that came in and out of our lives. He expressed his love so openly, we responded returning the affection.

Although the paper obituary states he came west in 1914, it was 1922 when he followed brother [(14) Frederick Francis Fitzpatrick](/14-frederick-francis-fitzpatrick/) west on the ‘harvest trains.’ Because of the First World War, there was a shortage of young men on the farms, to harvest the grain. There was also unemployment throughout the Maritimes and anyone interested was transported from farm to farm, across the country, until the harvest was brought in. Gordon made it to Calgary, Alberta, and both Fred and Gordon boarded with their sister [(28i) Jessie Maitland Fitzpatrick](/28i-jessie-maitland-fitzpatrick/) and her family, who had arrived in Calgary in 1919.

Gordon had not yet had his twentieth birthday when his mother died in 1924. Soon after, he married Margaret Finley, a much older woman. They had two sons, William and Harold, but this marriage was doomed to fail, from the start.

Gordon worked for the Co-op Milk Company, delivering milk by horse and wagon. Then he was hired by Four-X Bakery and delivered bread, also by horse and wagon.

After his marriage to Margaret ended, and Gordon had met Ann Brokie, he was transferred with Four-X Bakery to Edmonton, Alberta, so he would be nearer to Ann. He frequently returned to Calgary to his sister Maitland’s and to see his boys. Margaret filed for divorce to give Gordon his freedom and he married Ann in 1936. They were lovebirds the rest of their lives together. However, when Margaret was diagnosed with a brain tumor, Gordon was at her bedside to the end. Margaret died in 1958.

Gordon and Ann had no children but their lives were full with the families of William and Harold. Harold accumulated considerable wealth and showered Gordon and Ann with gifts. Harold, Ethel, Ann and Gordon, took many cruises together and spent January in Hawaii for nineteen consecutive years. It was on their return from Hawaii to Edmonton one year, niece Lorraine met them at the Vancouver airport to visit while they waited for their connecting flight.

During my childhood (Lorraine), approaching our house coming home from school, I was always thrilled to see Uncle Gordon’s car parked in front of our house. He would be down from Edmonton for a visit with his family and maybe take in the horse races. In my teens, a visit to Edmonton with my friends was highlighted with a stop at Fitz’s Fish and Chips, Uncle Gordon’s restaurant. Cousin Delores had paid him a visit there also. Gordon had opened the restaurant for an easier way to make a living, after suffering a brain hemorrhage while working for the bakery. Ann continued her career in the accounting department of Henry Birks and Sons Jewellers.

During the Second World War, brothers Fred and Gordon met in Abolena, Italy, just outside of Naples, January 1st, 1944. They had not seen one another for five years. Did they celebrate!

Gordon and Ann visited Bert and Lorraine (Fitzpatrick) Kirkham in Vancouver on more than one occasion, but were to see more of one another when Bert and Lorraine were moved from Vancouver to Calgary in the early 70’s. Initially, Gordon and Ann lived in a mobile home park near Lorraine’s home and where Lorraine’s daughter Lynette took piano lessons. Lorraine often stopped by for a cold drink during the piano lesson. Often, Harold’s Ethel was there for a visit.

When the trailer park was disbanded, Gordon and Ann moved to a beautiful condo across Fish Creek, in a district of Calgary that at one time was the town of Midnapore. By this time, Gordon preferred to be driven, rather than drive himself, and Lorraine would take Gordon and Ann to visit his sisters.

It was not uncommon for Lorraine’s phone to ring in an evening and it be Uncle Gordon, ready for a chat after he had had a few drinks. These calls would be good for a chuckle.

Gordon started to have a husky voice, which progressed to him finding it hard to swallow. He was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus. Lorraine’s family was in the midst of their move back to the west coast and retirement. The day they left Calgary, they drove around to Rockyview Hospital for Lorraine to go in to say goodbye. Gordon was pleased to see her but only for about ten minutes. He said, “You’d better go and catch your bus”. They embraced. What did it matter that their means of transport would be driving their own car?

Gordon was gone one week later, April 8, 1986. Ann was eventually placed in a nursing home in Calgary where she lapsed into dementia. When niece Marilyn last visited her, she was in a deep sleep so Marilyn did not disturb her. Ann died on March 17th, 2002 at the age of 94.
