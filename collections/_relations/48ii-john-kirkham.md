#### Biography

*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]] after reading letters [[(12) Alfred Kirkham]] received from his second cousin [[Francis Albert 'Billy' Kirkham]].*

John was the second child born to [[(48) Richard Kirkham]] and [[(49) Sarah Wherton]], on December 30, 1853, on Park Lane, Tipton, Staffordshire, England.

John and brother [[(24) Richard Kirkham]] (Gramp) worked together in the coal industry: _refer to details recorded detailing Richard’s life._

John and his wife Mary, known to the family as Uncle Jack and Aunt Polly, attended the wedding of Richard’s son, [[(12) Alfred Kirkham]] to [[(13) Elsie Holland]], on June 11, 1916, at the Parish Church in Tipton.  Also in attendance were John’s son Wilfred and his wife May, and John’s daughter Clara. Wilfred and Clara were, obviously, Alfred’s cousins.

John’s brother Richard had been living in Nanaimo, B.C., Canada, since 1913, but had returned to England when he heard of his brothers death, to attend John’s funeral.  Richard stayed for a few days at his nephew Albert’s, John’s son.

Albert’s full name was Francis Albert, second cousin [[Francis Albert 'Billy' Kirkham]]’s father.

John died January 29, 1919.
