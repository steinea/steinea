#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-h-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

Auntie Maitland was [(28) John Thomas Fitzpatrick](/28-john-thomas-fitzpatrick/) and [(29) Mary Elizabeth Bowland](/29-mary-elizabeth-bowland/)’s first child born Sept. 16, 1895, in Saint John, New Brunswick. Maitland went through life carrying the responsibility that goes with being the oldest child.

Jessie Maitland Fitzpatrick and Frank Ashley were married at St. James Anglican Church on June 27, 1917, in Saint John, New Brunswick. Maitland met Frank because he was one of the English children sent to work on Canadian farms. He arrived at the Bowland’s in Sussex Corner, New Brunswick. Frank’s surname at birth was Millington but he was given the name Ashley when he was sent to Canada.

Frank joined the army in 1912. From that experience, he knew there was opportunity out west. The First World War had ended and Frank had been offered a job in Calgary, Alberta. In 1919, Maitland and Frank boarded the train in Saint John, New Brunswick, with all the hope of a better future. Frank worked for G. L. Chestney, as a tinsmith. He was putting the eaves trough on St. Mary’s School and injured his back. As a result, he had to change profession. He went to work for Pilkington Glass. Frank would eventually get a job with the City of Calgary Transit Company, where he would work until retirement.

Maitland was pregnant coming west on the train. Their daughter, Audrey Florence, was born in Calgary, Alberta, on April 12, 1919. Audrey would bless them with nine grandchildren.

Maitland and Frank lived near St. Hilda’s College in the 1800 block on 12th Avenue. Audrey has a picture of Grandpa John Thomas Fitzpatrick standing with Frank in the yard at this home, Frank standing proudly beside a display of crafts he had made.

Another address for the Ashley’s was 464 - 19th Ave. N. W., near St. Joseph’s Church.

Audrey went to Balmoral School. In 1928, her parents purchased a house at 211 - 11th Street N. W. for $1600.00. Nine year old Audrey delivered the $25.00 monthly cheque in payment to the bachelor Mr. Maitland from whom they had purchased the house.

Maitland was suffering greatly from epilepsy at the time and the doctor suggested a move to the ocean might help. Maitland and Audrey moved to Vancouver and lived for two months across from St. Paul’s Hospital.

When sister [(28ii) Annie Catherine Fitzpatrick](/28ii-annie-catherine-fitzpatrick/) and brothers [(14) Frederick Francis Fitzpatrick](/14-frederick-francis-fitzpatrick/) and [(28v) Gordon William Fitzpatrick](/28v-gordon-william-fitzpatrick/) arrived in Calgary, it was Frank and Maitland that housed each one until they got on their feet financially. They also raised brother [(28vii) John Harold Fitzpatrick](28vii-john-harold-fitzpatrick/) when Maitland’s mother died. He was twelve years old. They were living near St. Hilda’s College on 12th Avenue when Gordon arrived in 1922, just after Fred’s arrival in 1921. Throughout Harold’s life, Maitland helped him with money never saying anything to anyone about it.

Frank and Maitland attended St. Barnabas Anglican Church and were active in the Bow Valley Credit Union. Frank was a mason and Maitland belonged to the Eastern Star.

Maitland had an enormous influence on all her nieces and nephews. Her standards were high. Through the years when Audrey was growing up, their home was always open for meals or to stay overnight if home was too far to go in a storm. In later years, she took the young people out for tea to learn their social graces. It’s easy to recall the transit picnic at Bowness annually and all those free rides and dixie cups.

Auntie Maitland was always nice to the children in the family but she was serious. She could share a chuckle but we all knew it was better to behave. Nephew Everett Roy Fitzpatrick, a growing boy, could consume large quantities of food, a point she never missed. When nieces Delores and Marilyn would visit, Auntie Maitland fed them leftovers. She always stood in the kitchen while the girls sat in the kitchen booth. Always nice but she had this firm way about her.

Both Maitland and Frank were gifted working with their hands. Maitland’s crocheted items were exceptional and Frank’s woodwork always unique. Maitland won many first place ribbons at the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede.

Maitland was an astute businesswoman and supported anyone in the family needing assistance. She didn’t take any nonsense, mind you.

Her health was poor at times. A severe fever had caused the bouts of epilepsy mentioned previously. Once while ironing, she fell with her arm burning against the hot iron, which caused a severe scar. Gallbladder surgery and removal of some of her stomach came mid-life after the epilepsy had ceased.

When they sold their home on Kensington Road, they moved to Regency Towers on 4th Avenue S. W. While living there, Frank died on October 2nd, 1972. Maitland had ‘meals on wheels’ towards the end of her stay there. One time she asked her niece Lorraine if she would make her a date loaf so she would have something nice to serve if she had a visitor.

She was to end her days at Sarcee Auxiliary Hospital in south Calgary. Nieces Marilyn and Lorraine often visited her and towards the end would leave amused at their aunt stuffing possessions, even food, down her bra so they’d not be taken.

Maitland died August 9, 1982. Maitland and Frank are buried in Mountainview Memorial Gardens, Calgary, Alberta.
