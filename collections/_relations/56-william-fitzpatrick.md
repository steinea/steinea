#### Biography

*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]]. Delores (Fitzpatrick) Pfeiffer did the research in Nova Scotia providing us with the documentation from Saint Mary’s Basilica.*

William was born in Newfoundland somewhere from 1838 to 1843. It is important that everyone read what I have written under the heading [[(112) Henry Fitzpatrick]], William’s father.

William moved with his family to Halifax, Nova Scotia.

On May 4th, 1868, William married [[(57) Mary Fitzgibbons]] in Saint Mary’s Basilica in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Mary was born in St. John’s Newfoundland on September 4th, 1850. William’s occupation ‘seaman’ is registered on both the marriage record of 1868, and the 1871 Census.

Apparently, the Fitzpatrick and Fitzgibbons families chose to leave Newfoundland together headed for Halifax, Nova Scotia, and moved together to New Brunswick.

In 1872, our grandfather [[(28) John Thomas Fitzpatrick]] was born to William and Mary. Record of his baptism was photocopied by permission of Saint Mary’s Basilica and recorded for the Nova Scotia Public Archives from the church records. The families moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, one year later.

William and Mary would have six more children. They were [[(56ii) Martha Fitzpatrick]], [[(56iii) Johannah Fitzpatrick]], [[(56iv) William Louis Fitzpatrick]], [[(56v) Charles Fitzpatrick]], [[(56vi) Michael Fitzpatrick]], and [[(56vii) Robert A. Fitzpatrick]]. Only Charles remained in Canada. He died in Halifax, N.S. Michael worked in New York as a sign painter for the Coca Cola Company and died there. The remaining five lived and worked in Boston, Mass.

Census records for 1881, 1891 and 1901 find both families, Fitzpatrick and Fitzgibbons, living in Saint John, New Brunswick. William’s occupation changed to ‘labourer,’ and then ‘foreman gas works,’ a position he held for the City of Saint John.

William died on May 27, 1908 in Saint John, New Brunswick, where he was buried in St. Joseph’s Roman Catholic Cemetery.

Mary moved to Boston after William died living in the same building as John and Martha. Mary died in Boston, May 13, 1940, and was buried in Mt. Benedict Cemetery.
