#### Biography

*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]] after reading letters [[(12) Alfred Kirkham]] received from his second cousin [[Francis Albert 'Billy' Kirkham]].*

Alfred Kirkham was [[(48) Richard Kirkham]]’s ninth child, but the first child with second wife [[Elizabeth Rogers]].  He was born November 27, 1870, Foundry Street, Tipton, Staffordshire, England.

Alfred married Laura Griffin, Dec. 31, 1894.  They had ten children:  Alfred, George, Wilfred, Horace, Laura, Albert, Lucy, Dennis, Elizabeth and Walter.

Billy Kirkham met Alfred, (his Dad’s uncle), at his father’s pub and when visiting Alfred’s General Store where Alfred was a butcher.  A quote from Billy, “He used to amuse me.  I visited his store many times in Greets Green.  He had an ‘Off-Licence’ too”.

In the letters from Billy from 1972, Billy had received a letter from Mrs. Ann Pugh, a granddaughter of Alfred.
