#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-h-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

Mary Elizabeth Bowland, daughter of [(58) Thomas James Bowland](/58-thomas-james-bowland/) and [(59) Catherine Anderson](/59-catherine-anderson/), is my grandmother. She was born at Jeffries Corner, near Sussex, New Brunswick, November 15, 1869.

How a farm girl came to meet a city fellow, we do not know, but in 1894 when she was twenty-two years old, Mary married John Thomas Fitzpatrick. It was not a church wedding. Mary was raised an Anglican and John a Roman Catholic. This would create problems with the family throughout their lives.

John and Mary had ten children, although, twin girls died at birth. They had three daughters before a son was born, my father, [(14) Frederick Francis Fitzpatrick](/14-frederick-francis-fitzpatrick/).

The two older girls, [(28i) Jessie Maitland Fitzpatrick](/28i-jessie-maitland-fitzpatrick/) and [(28ii) Annie Catherine Fitzpatrick](/28ii-annie-catherine-fitzpatrick/), initially were sent to a Catholic School. Maitland in particular was treated badly by a nun and when her father went to see the priest about the abuse, the priest told him “what did it matter. Your kids are illegitimate anyway” (John’s marriage was not in the Catholic church). When John arrived home and told Mary what had happened, he told her to raise the children in her church saying, “no priest is going to tell me my kids are illegitimate.” From that day onward, John’s parents did not visit his family. They stood at the fence of their home on a Sunday morning to watch their grandchildren pass enroute to their Anglican Sunday School.

As a labourer, John worked hard for little remuneration and Mary did washing for others to make enough to feed the family. It was a hard life. In time, jobs were plentiful if you could commute to the United States, which John ended up doing. He worked in Boston, Massachusetts returning to Saint John on weekends. Some of his siblings worked in both New York and Boston.

In 1919, daughter Maitland with husband Frank Ashley moved west to Calgary, Alberta. Their departure was made easier in the knowledge that Frank had a job waiting for him. Soon Annie and Fred would follow. Next would be [(28v) Gordon William Fitzpatrick](/28v-gordon-william-fitzpatrick/).

Their daughter [(28iii) Mary Muriel Fitzpatrick](/28iii-mary-muriel-fitzpatrick/) died in 1921, at the age of twenty-two, from a ruptured appendix. It was such a shock for Mary and she was visiting the graveside every day. John became so worried about her that he asked their daughter Maitland if they could come west for a visit. Their daughter [(28vi) Dorothy Jean Fitzpatrick](/28vi-dorothy-jean-fitzpatrick/), age fifteen, stayed with Mary’s sister [(58vi) Annie Maud Bowland](/58vi-annie-maud-bowland/) while son [(28vii) John Harold Fitzpatrick](/28vii-john-harold-fitzpatrick/), age eleven, and daughter [(28viii) Audrey Heloise Fitzpatrick](/28viii-audrey-heloise-fitzpatrick/), age nine, traveled west with their parents. Mary wasn’t well so they stayed on in Calgary, however, she died in Calgary on July 12, 1924.

John didn’t know how he could raise Harold and Audrey and work in Boston. It was a mutual agreement that Dorothy would stay on and be raised by her Aunt Maud. Annie took Audrey with her to her home in Saskatchewan, while Harold stayed with Maitland in Calgary. John returned to Boston where his mother, sister and two brothers lived.
