#### Biography

*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]].*

Will, as he was called by his family, was the fourth child born to [[(56) William Fitzpatrick]]  and [[(57) Mary Fitzgibbons]], in 1880, in Saint John, New Brunswick.

Will’s career was in hotel management in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and in Fredericton, New Brunswick, before moving to Boston, Massachusetts.

In 1905, Will married Emily Flowers, in Fredericton and that is where their first daughter Helen was born in 1905. Their daughter Doris Evelyn was born November 10, 1916, in Nova Scotia.

Will and Emily chose to raise daughter Helen in the Catholic faith and Doris as a Protestant, in keeping with their personal differences, Will being Catholic and Emily Protestant.

Helen married Charles Reid, an engineer, on June 29, 1929, in Brookline, Massachusetts. They raised six sons.

Doris married Charles Marks, a medical doctor, on September 15, 1935, in Manchester By The Sea, Massachusetts. They raised one son and one daughter.

The family talked about Will’s artistic ability. He painted scenery and one of his paintings hung in the hotel in Fredericton where he worked. It should be noted that his daughter Doris is a commercial artist.

It was Uncle Will, who wrote from Roslindale in Massachusetts, to his niece Annie in 1941 to inform her of her father’s death.

When Bert and Lorraine were in Boston, they drove around to Uncle Will’s address in Brookline, to see where they had lived.

Will died on October 30, 1949. You will notice on the death certificate that he was suicidal during temporary insanity. He was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Brighton, Massachusetts. It can be observed on the death certificate that Uncle Will’s full name was William Louis.

Emily died in 1968 in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania.
