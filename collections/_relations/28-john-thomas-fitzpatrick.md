#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-h-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

What little personal information I have about my grandfather, John Thomas Fitzpatrick, is what I heard growing up listening to my parents, aunts and uncles.

John was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia on May 8th, 1872. Saint Mary’s Basilica baptism records say May 5, whereas Public Archives records say May 8 and we know he celebrated his birthday on the 8th of May.

The family moved to Saint John, New Brunswick when John was one year old and that is where he grew up. In 1894, John Thomas Fitzpatrick married [(29) Mary Elizabeth Bowland](/29-mary-elizabeth-bowland/). With John a Roman Catholic and Mary an Anglican, it was not a church wedding.

Without a trade, and Irish, John worked as a labourer and struggled to support a growing family. When the opportunity came to work for better remuneration in Boston, Mass., U.S.A., he joined the ranks of many Maritimers commuting by train. In Boston, he worked at different jobs but was listed as a retired night watchman for General Motors Corporation upon his death.

John was a kind and loving husband and father, but like so many others, tended to overindulge in the use of alcohol. Mary took in laundry to raise her own money to feed the children brown bread and molasses during the week when John was away at work. All too often he returned from Boston on a weekend inebriated. I recall my father saying, “he came home drunk and long enough to make another baby. He’d kneel beside the bed saying his rosary. It turned me against his religion.”

As the children grew older and started to work, life was easier for everyone. After the First World War, in search of a better future, married eldest daughter [(28i) Jessie Maitland Fitzpatrick](/28i-jessie-maitland-fitzpatrick/) and her husband Frank Ashley, prepared to leave New Brunswick. In 1919, they boarded the train for Calgary, Alberta, and Frank’s new job in that city. One by one, the rest of the family would follow.

When daughter [(28iii) Mary Muriel Fitzpatrick](/28iii-mary-muriel-fitzpatrick/) died suddenly of ruptured appendix in 1921, and Mary was grieving, John wrote and asked Maitland if they could come to visit, feeling Mary’s spirits would be revived to see the rest of the family. John and Mary, with little [(28vii) John Harold Fitzpatrick](/28vii-john-harold-fitzpatrick/) and [(28viii) Audrey Heloise Fitzpatrick](/28viii-audrey-heloise-fitzpatrick/), visited Calgary in 1923. My mother and father, Vena Sarah Ann Lougheed and [(14) Frederick Francis Fitzpatrick](/14-frederick-francis-fitzpatrick/), were newly married. My mother was very fond of John. She could see the similarity of her husband Fred with his father. They were both smart dressers. Mom once said, “he (John) looked like a million dollars with a penny in his pocket.”

When Mary died in Calgary on July 12, 1924, John had to return to work in Boston. He was not alone there as his widowed mother, a sister and three brothers [(56iv) William Louis Fitzpatrick](/56iv-william-louis-fitzpatrick/), [(56vi) Michael Fitzpatrick](/56vi-michael-fitzpatrick/), and [(56vii) Robert A. Fitzpatrick](/56vii-robert-a-fitzpatrick/), lived in Boston at the time. Although Maitland and Fred visited their father after his return to Boston, John never returned to Calgary. He shared accommodation with his widowed mother and bachelor brother Robert, from 1932 onward. When [(6) Albert Kirkham](/6-albert-kirkham/) and I (Lorraine) visited Boston in 1985, we drove by the apartment block they had lived in at 181 Magnolia Street, in the Boston suburb of Dorchester.

John died October 17, 1941, in Boston, at age 69. He is buried in Mt. Benedict Cemetery beside his sister Martha and nearby, his mother.
