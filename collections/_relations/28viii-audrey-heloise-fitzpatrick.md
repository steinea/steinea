#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-h-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

Audrey Heloise was the youngest child born to [(28) John Thomas Fitzpatrick](/28-john-thomas-fitzpatrick/) and [(29) Mary Elizabeth Bowland](/29-mary-elizabeth-bowland/), on May 13, 1914, in Saint John, New Brunswick. She was only five years old when her eldest sister [(28i) Jessie Maitland Fitzpatrick](/28i-jessie-maitland-fitzpatrick/) and husband Frank left by train for a new life in Calgary, Alberta.

In 1923, Audrey with brother [(28vii) John Harold Fitzpatrick](/28vii-john-harold-fitzpatrick/) and their parents, traveled by train to Calgary to visit all the family members that had made the move west. Her mother took ill and died in 1924. Audrey was only nine years old. Her father wanted to return east, and to Boston where his mother and some siblings were living. He was also certain of employment in Boston. It was decided that sister [(28vi) Dorothy Jean Fitzpatrick](/28vi-dorothy-jean-fitzpatrick/) would stay on living with aunt [(58vi) Annie Maud Bowland](/58vi-annie-maud-bowland/) in Saint John; that Harold would live with sister Maitland and family; and Audrey would live with [(28ii) Annie Catherine Fitzpatrick](/28ii-annie-catherine-fitzpatrick/) and family. It wasn’t too long before it was obvious that Audrey would be better at Aunt Maud’s, and that is where she was raised, in Saint John.

Aunt Maud wasn’t able to control Audrey’s reckless spirit and Audrey married Don Handren, in her seventeenth year. Of course, it was a mistake, and Audrey and her baby girl, Vivian Fay, returned to live with Aunt Maud. By 1946, Audrey married Eddie Tennant and they had a happy life together.

Audrey and Eddie moved west to Calgary in 1952, joining the rest of the family. Eddie worked as a salesman for Kelly Douglas Wholesale Company and later Audrey and Eddie operated their own restaurant. Audrey’s niece Marilyn remembers how she felt about Aunt Audrey when she arrived in Calgary. We all had the same reaction it seems. As Marilyn said, “I thought, what a different aunt.” She was different from Auntie Maitland and Aunt Annie, whom we’d known all our lives. Perhaps it was because her Aunt Maud and not her mother had raised her. She told sort of risqué stories and had quite a devilish laugh. Uncle Eddie always looked at her like she was wonderful.

Audrey was proud of their home in Fairview. She was an immaculate housekeeper, a trait that didn’t please everyone.

Marilyn remembers being in a Weight Watchers class in the 1980’s and she heard this little giggle. The voice was distinctive only to Marilyn. She got a kick out of her aunt in the class. She did get her weight down, but unfortunately, Marilyn did not.

After Marilyn’s father died, Marilyn liked to look at Aunt Audrey because her eyes looked just like his.

Audrey used to say to Marilyn, that she looked like Audrey’s daughter Fay, a cousin we never did meet.

Eddie and Audrey loved living in Calgary but also loved to return to New Brunswick. In later years, Eddie had heart problems, and he started to walk around Fairview picking up beer and pop cans. He collected enough to pay their way to travel east quite often to visit Fay and her family, and other relatives in New Brunswick. It was through Aunt Audrey that our cousin Delores, Marilyn’s older sister, was able to make the acquaintance of some of our Bowland relatives.

Maitland’s daughter Audrey and Aunt Audrey were very close.

Audrey’s heart failed in the end, her final weeks spent at Southwood Nursing Home. She died December 20, 1996. Eddie’s regret was that she died when he was not at home. Had he known death was so near, he would have never left her side.
