#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-h-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

Annie Catherine was [(28) John Thomas Fitzpatrick](/28-john-thomas-fitzpatrick) and [(29) Mary Elizabeth Bowland](/29-mary-elizabeth-bowland/)’s second child, born November 3, 1896, in Saint John, New Brunswick. Aunt Annie was our ‘fun’ aunt. When she was a child, she kept her siblings entertained telling stories in the hayloft of the barn at their uncle [(58iii) Joseph Handford Bowland](/58iii-joseph-handford-bowland/)’s farm in Sussex, New Brunswick. What an imagination! This was to carry on throughout her life.

I remember how she fantasized that someone was living in the attic of their house on 33rd Avenue S. W. Once my Dad [(14) Frederick Francis Fitzpatrick](/14-frederick-francis-fitzpatrick/) said, “If someone is living in the attic Annie, why is it the icicles on the gutters aren’t yellow?” She went so far as to claim she had left a slice of bread on the counter and it was gone when she returned home. All of this was totally harmless and amusing to everyone.

Annie and my mother (15) Vena Sarah Ann Lougheed met one another as work mates at Woolworth’s. It was Annie who introduced Vena to her brother Fred inviting Vena to a costume party she was having for Halloween. Annie and Vena were good friends before they became sister-in-laws.

In 1915, eighteen year old Annie, traveled with her father from Saint John, New Brunswick to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to meet Harry Fay who was returning from his involvement in World War I. They visited her father’s brothers [(56iv) William Louis Fitzpatrick](/56iv-william-louis-fitzpatrick/) and [(56v) Charles Fitzpatrick](/56v-charles-fitzpatrick/) who managed a hotel in Halifax.

Annie followed Maitland and Frank in going to Calgary, Alberta. Harry followed to ‘woo’ her and take her after their marriage October 24, 1924, to his farm in Hellendale, Saskatchewan.

After a few years, they left the farm and moved to Calgary, now with daughter Dorothy who was born November 6, 1926, and their only child.

After working at some odd jobs, Harry was hired by the City of Calgary as a garbage collector where he worked until he retired.

In the late 40’s, Harry built a new home on 33rd Avenue S. W. Annie’s brother Fred had sold their home and for one year while waiting to take possession of their home, with Harry and Annie’s permission, moved his family in with Annie and Harry. This included Fred, Vena, Everett and Lorraine, who was eight years old at the time. Muriel was married and living in Toronto.

When they lived at this address, their daughter Dorothy, married with three children named Dale, Edward (Teddy) and Madeline, lived almost kiddy-corner from them on 34th Ave.

Annie, never a good money-manager, constantly borrowed $2.00 from Vena. She would pay it back on payday and borrow it again two or three days later, much to Vena’s amusement. She loved to study her Bible delving into prophecy, which resulted in many hours of discussion with Vena who tried to keep things on an even keel, or in perspective so to speak.

After Harry died, Annie went to Vancouver to visit old friends and a brother of Harry. Her niece Lorraine was living very near where Annie was staying and it was so nice for Lorraine to have her come to visit. Annie’s friends were great growers of geraniums. Lorraine’s mother Vena was living with Lorraine and her family at that time, now wheelchair bound with multiple sclerosis. Annie and Vena had a great time being together to visit again.

Some years later, with Vena living in Sarcee Auxiliary Hospital in Calgary, Annie and brother Fred rented a house together for a while. Annie also tried living in lodge housing for seniors and met a man named Stanley Wakelyn. They were always together on lodge outings and decided they could take an apartment together. Annie told her nieces that she married Stan in 1973 to do the proper thing.

Their time together was short perhaps as Stan passed away Dec. 24, 1978, but they were like teenagers in love, downtown shopping and out for lunch every day. Once Everett, Annette, Bert and Lorraine met them on the street in Bowness and Stan had absentmindedly gone out in his plaid slippers. It was all fun to him. Standing on the sidewalk, he did a jig for us.

Nieces Marilyn and Lorraine had many fun outings with their aunt after Stan died and Annie was living in a nursing home. It was their intention to take her out for tea and dessert but invariably, having had lunch in the nursing home, she would order another meal and dessert.

Although Annie had had her gallbladder removed, she was generally in good health. She was born with one kidney but it was a weak heart that took her in the end.
