#### Biography

*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]]*.

Henry Fitzpatrick and his wife [[(113) Ann Molloy]] are shown as the parents of [[(56) William Fitzpatrick]], at the time of William’s marriage to [[(57) Mary Fitzgibbons]] on May 4, 1868, in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Henry and his wife had emigrated from Ireland. Additional information states Henry was a farmer. No additional records have been located to date.

There are times when variations of some of the names occur. It must be realized that at the time said records were made, only those that could write kept the records and they recorded the names as they heard them. A thick Irish accent could have been quite difficult to decipher and spelling would not matter to the uneducated.

Since little is known about Henry, I found reading the book titled [*Irish Emigration and Canadian Settlement: Patterns, Links, and Letters*](https://utorontopress.com/9780802069108/irish-emigration-and-canadian-settlement/) by Cecil J. Houston and William J. Smyth most helpful. Some excerpts from the book are as follows:

> ... the transfer of Irish communities is further emphasized in the cases of Newfoundland and Halifax which derived their Irish populations from an even narrower set of origins. The almost total dominance of the southeast of Ireland in Newfoundland’s population; that regional emphasis can be interpreted as one particular linkage subdued within a larger pattern of rather diverse transatlantic trading connections.[^1]

> The principal phase of Irish emigration to Canada lasted but four decades, 1815-55. Subsequent migrations, smaller in scale and relatively insignificant, did little to alter the character of the Canadian Irish established by the nineteenth-century pioneers. The pioneers had come primarily from northern [Leinster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leinster "Leinster is one of the provinces of Ireland, situated in the southeast and east of Ireland. The province comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Meath, Leinster and Osraige. Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, the historic "fifths" of Leinster and Meath gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of the Pale, which straddled both, thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster. The ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes. In later centuries, local government legislation has prompted further sub-division of the historic counties.") and [Ulster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster "Ulster is one of the four traditional Irish provinces. It is made up of nine counties: six of these constitute Northern Ireland (a part of the United Kingdom); the remaining three are in the Republic of Ireland. Historically, Ulster lay at the heart of the Gaelic world made up of Gaelic Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man. According to tradition, in ancient Ireland it was one of the fifths ruled by a rí ruirech, or "king of over-kings." It is named after the overkingdom of Ulaid, in the east of the province, which was in turn named after the Ulaid folk.") and to a lesser extent [Cork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Cork "County Cork is the largest and the southernmost county of Ireland, named after the city of Cork, the state's second-largest city. It is in the province of Munster and the Southern Region. The county is known as the "rebel county," a name given to it by King Henry VII of England for its support, in a futile attempt at a rebellion in 1491, of Perkin Warbeck, who claimed to be Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York.") and represented a much wider constituency than that indicated by the southeast’s links to Irish settlement in Newfoundland (the fishery) and Nova Scotia.[^2]

> Recent research has done much to document the specific denominational background of Irish immigrants---an issue of significance, given the social character of Ireland. However, much of the research effort has been concentrated on Irish communities in Atlantic Canada and almost invariably identifies Irishness with Catholicism. Certainly, the Irish of Newfoundland were Catholic. Studies have shown that the origin of the majority of Newfoundland’s Catholic Irish was an area within a forty-mile radius of the port of Waterford. As such, they were less than typical of the much larger numbers of Irish who settled in the mainland regions.[^3]

> The central and northern Irish counties were least represented in Newfoundland, and Cork’s role was also less significant, with Waterford, Wexford, south Tipperary, and Kilkenny being the only major sources of Irish Newfoundlanders. In Saint John, the counties of Londonderry, Donegal, Fermanagh, Cork, Limerick were primary suppliers of Catholic emigrants.[^4]

> The Irish pioneering experience in British North America was not the prerogative of single men. For Newfoundland’s fisheries and New Brunswick’s timber industry a prevalence of men was more likely, but wherever permanent agricultural settlements were to be built, Irish emigration flows were either based on family or directed at that objective. In Newfoundland, there was forged from an early stage a unique amalgam of clergy and laity based on their local Irish origins. As has been indicated earlier, the Irish population of Newfoundland was almost totally Catholic and largely derived from a single region in southeast Ireland. In the early years, the Newfoundland church was served by priests and bishops drawn from the same area. For more than half a century the leadership of the Catholic church in Newfoundland was derived from the same region as the laity.[^5]

> The localism represented in the Newfoundland hierarchy was found also among the clergy. Until late in the nineteenth century the island’s parochial clergymen were drawn mainly from Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford, and Wexford, and many of the nuns and Christian Brothers who staffed Newfoundland’s convents, monasteries, and schools were selected from the same regions. This seemingly all-pervasive regional identity was unique to Newfoundland in the North American Catholic church.[^6]

> The regional association between clergy and laity was both a strength and a weakness. Many of the Irish in Newfoundland, being from the southeast, were native Gaelic speakers and could communicate easily in the language with O'Donel (first consecrated bishop) and with their priests. However, the regional association permitted many Old World grievances of family and territorial groups to spill over into the ecclesiastical realm. Newfoundland retained much of the traditional rivalry between Leinster and Munster men---between Kilkenny and Tipperary men in particular.[^7]

> The earliest and most distinctively Irish region in North America was created in Newfoundland, particularly on the Avalon Peninsula, the North American point closest to Ireland and because of its fisheries a natural target for European merchants. From the late sixteenth century, migratory fishing fleets containing Irish sailors had crossed the Atlantic to the rich fishing grounds of the Grand Banks, which became known in Irish vernacular as ‘Talamh an Eisc.’ Eighteenth-century Gaelic poets celebrated this ‘fishing ground’ far to the west, and in the communities of southeastern Ireland there were many men who had served a season or more in the Newfoundland fisheries. That seasonal migration was the precursor of a more permanent emigration from the same source region, and beginning in the 1760’s permanent Irish fishing settlements were apparent onshore. The emigration lasted until the 1820’s and eventually involved more than 30,000 emigrants.[^8]

> In the imperial drive for resources, the Newfoundland cod fisheries became Britain’s first great staple in North America. Irish merchants from Waterford and Youghal would join their English counterparts across the St. George’s Channel in Bristol, Poole, and Weymouth in exploiting the resource. Mercantile competition led to the creation of discrete spheres of commerce in Newfoundland, where certain bays and long stretches of coastline came to be recognized as English or Irish shores. The fishing villages along them acquired similarly an English or Irish identity, the merchants tending to settle people from their home region. The fate of the Irish communities was intimately bound up with the role of the Irish merchants and their transatlantic empires. In most instances it was the merchant who had recruited the settlers, sailed them across the Atlantic in his ships, provided work, and monopolized the market for the fish they caught. The role of the merchant was evident also in the cessation of emigration. The collapse of the fisheries and provisions trade and a reorientation of mercantile interests in the 1830’s attenuated the links between Ireland and ‘Talamh an Eisc’. Ten years before the Famine, the migration outflow from Ireland to Newfoundland ceased.[^9]

> The Newfoundland Irish community matured largely in isolation from the direct influences of other cultures and remained quite distinct from the other ethnic group on the island, the English of the southwest. Transferred Irish material and oral folk culture, music, and in some instances the Gaelic language were preserved virtually intact. Fisheries provided the principal economic reason for the settlement: the island’s agricultural resources were meagre, giving rise to little more than spade cultivation. Even in those areas where alluvial stretches of ground allowed small farms to be taken from the forest, agricultural pioneering was very slow, difficult, and rarely brought the pioneer above a subsistence level. In the harsh and isolated conditions of the settlements, the essence of southeastern Ireland’s culture was protected from the challenges of other cultures. The Irish population was small, confined by the narrow source region of its origin and by the bonds of kinship maintained by that origin and the Catholic faith. Settlements were scattered along the southern shores of the Avalon Peninsula and a few bays to the north, in a series of isolated coves and inlets, and kinship links were made intense by geographically restricted marriage fields. The Catholic faith was also a formative force in the transplanted cultural identity. The exclusive bond between the Newfoundland Irish laity and its clergy was both a symptom and a further reinforcing element in the culture of the Newfoundland Irish. Continuity and stability were guaranteed, and an unusually homogeneous cultural region was created and maintained.[^10]

> Elsewhere in Atlantic Canada, Irish settlers were drawn by different economies and from a wider set of regional origins, and two other major emigrant geographies were created. The provisions trade that interlinked a small core region in southeastern Ireland with Newfoundland was extended gradually to include a larger British North American realm centered on the Gulf of Lawrence, including Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia east from Halifax, the north shore of New Brunswick, and the valley of the Miramichi River.[^11]

> From the early eighteenth century, Newfoundland had been a primary destination of young men from southeastern Ireland, but Newfoundland’s meagre agricultural resources and limitations in its fishing economy led many Irish on the island to move on to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and New England.[^12]

To me this is very much our Fitzpatrick story.
