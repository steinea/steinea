The following was written in the Lougheed Families of North America Newsletter, Vol. 3, No. 1, March 1992. Researched and collected by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]].

> On July 12, 1690, William III, King of England, Scotland, and Ireland, defeated James II at the Boyne River in Ireland. This Battle of the Boyne ended the struggle to oust the Catholic James from the throne and to replace him with his daughter Mary's Protestant Dutch husband, William, Prince of Orange.

> As a result of the defeat, the Protestant minority in Ireland became politically powerful and from that time on celebrated "the Glorious Twelfth." In 1795, the Orange Order, a Protestant fraternal society, was founded in Northern Ireland to commemorate the victory of William of Orange. During the Irish insurrection of 1798, the Order was the main link between the British government and Irish Protestants. Orangemen volunteered for the militia in large numbers and gained control of the civil service.

> With the passage of the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829, the Order lost much of its influence. The lodges adopted a Masonic-type ritual and organization. They provided mutual aid and organized social events.

> The Order came to Canada with Irish immigrants. The Grand Lodge of British North America was founded in Brockville on January 1, 1830. By 1844, a strong Orange vote induced John A. Macdonald to become an Orangeman. In 1867, there were 1,000 Loyal Orange Lodges in the country, and a third of all Canadian Protestant males, many of whom were not Irish, were members.

[[(14) Frederick Francis Fitzpatrick]], son of [[(28) John Thomas Fitzpatrick]], joined the Orangeman’s Lodge in Saint John New Brunswick in 1920 or so.

Cecil Houston, one of the authors of [*Irish Emigration and Canadian Settlement: Patterns, Links, and Letters*](https://utorontopress.com/9780802069108/irish-emigration-and-canadian-settlement/), wrote in the Globe and Mail of July 12, 1990:

> The fraternity has an elaborate ritual involving secret passwords, handshakes and signs. The secrecy and mystery encouraged potential recruits. In a time when opportunities for socializing were few, 'going to lodge' meant respectable nights out in a local Orange Hall. Before temperance, much of a lodge's budget was spent on whiskey and brown sugar for hot toddies. Being a member also offered brotherly benevolence in times of need.

> On the Twelfth of July (or the nearest Saturday), the Orange lodges march in regional centres. One of the members, costumed in the role of King William on horseback, leads his brethern along the main street. Lines of men in Orange regalia file behind with banners depicting King Billy.

[[(58) Thomas James Bowland]] at the time of his death, was the oldest Orangeman in New Brunswick.

The following is from William Perkins Bull’s publications during the 1930’s and 1940’s, [*From the Boyne to Brampton: Or, John the Orangeman at Home and Abroad*](https://books.google.ca/books/about/From_the_Boyne_to_Brampton.html?id=9tdYAAAAMAAJ):

> Today, the Boyne tradition is still maintained by some Canadian families, but public displays are rare. A few Anglican churches hold special services. There are still some parades, but the participants are usually old. Not many young people join the order except in Newfoundland where family tradition is strong. In Newfoundland, July 12 is an official public holiday.

To quote from Cecil Houston & William J Smyth (1990), again:

> But even in Newfoundland, Orange celebrations have quietened. Membership is low. The Orangemen claim 100,000... The same number of 100,000 could have been used at the time of Confederation. Today's fervor is also low. The reaction of Canadians to Orangeism is indifference - new Canadians may think of an Orange parade as a citrus festival.

But to our pioneer Bowland ancestors, the Orange Lodge was undoubtedly of considerable importance.
