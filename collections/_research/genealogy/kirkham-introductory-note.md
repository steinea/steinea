#### Acknowledgments

My heartfelt appreciation is extended to the late Francis Albert “Billy” Kirkham for his labour of love searching our family history from his home in Britain.  I should also acknowledge cousin Bernard Holland’s contribution on behalf of the Holland side of the family.

I am also grateful to cousin Dick, Clara, Alf, Jack, Lil and my husband Bert for their  confidence in allowing me to record their recollections in telling the Canadian story for the purpose of making this booklet.

Each one has presented their memories as they experienced life growing up in the home of Alfred and Elsie in Nanaimo.  In some respects, this effort was started too late.  The memories of those who have already passed on are missing and for the rest of us, it is our loss.

It is with thanks to my son Rob for his comments and suggestions after proof-reading the text.  Also for the encouragement of our nieces and nephews to continue with the project.

Most people when reading this family history will appreciate the massive amount of computer formatting required.  This could not have been accomplished without the cheerful willingness to help received from my son-in-law Chris Stein.  He was always willing to come to my aid when my limited computer knowledge failed me.

I do hope as you read this book, you will be enriched by the feeling of belonging to this family.

—Lorraine (Fitzpatrick) Kirkham, Year 2003

#### Introduction

In 1969, my father-in-law, [[(12) Alfred Kirkham]], received the first of many letters, from his second cousin in England, Francis Albert “Billy” Kirkham.  Billy wanted to know if they were related.  Indeed, they were.

As a result, my interest in Kirkham family history became rooted.  The years of correspondence between them, although too short, served to feed that interest.

During the time Alfred and Billy were corresponding, [[(12iii) Jack Kirkham]], Alfred’s second son, traveled to Britain with his wife June, and daughter Leslie, and visited with Billy and his family.  Billy used this opportunity to send the Kirkham family Bible with Jack to Alfred in Canada, whom he thought should have the Bible. Inside the Bible is a list of children born to Alfred and Billy’s great-grandparents, [[(48) Richard Kirkham]] and [[(49) Sarah Wherton]].

I have attempted to create the background of the Kirkham family in Britain through reading Billy’s letters. He was younger than Alfred and asked questions in aide of his own understanding of circumstances he experienced as a child.  It is unfortunate that the family in England only saved a few of Alfred’s letters sent to England.

The story of the Kirkham family in Canada begins in 1913, when Alfred had made the decision to leave his family in Britain and emigrate to Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada, where the prospects for work in coal mining were promising.  However, his family (including his widowed father [[(24) Richard Kirkham]]; his brother [[(24i) Richard Kirkham]] (Dick) and his wife Jane (Aunt Jen) and their baby son Richard (Dickie); and his sister Lilian) must have been intrigued by his decision and decided to accompany him.

Alfred and his father Richard would both return to Britain for a brief period of time.  When they returned to Nanaimo in 1920, Alfred had gained a wife and two children.

Life was not always easy but there was no looking back.  Alfred and [[(13) Elsie Holland]] raised seven children and were proud of the accomplishments of each one of them.

When you consider the years this work covers, the effort each of you made to relate your personal experiences within the larger circle of family was at times difficult.  I have attempted to record for the record, what was related to me.  In no way could I write from my own experience.  My apologies to those of you who remember missing details or events that should be here.
