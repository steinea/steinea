Excerpts from Cecil J. Houston and William J. Smyth's [*Irish Emigration and Canadian Settlement: Patterns, Links, and Letters*](https://utorontopress.com/9780802069108/irish-emigration-and-canadian-settlement/). Researched and collected by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]].

> Among adult male Irish immigrants arriving in British North America in the 1830’s, the labouring classes predominated, as might be expected in a mass exodus from a largely rural society.  Based on passenger lists from ships arriving in Saint John, labourers made up almost three quarters of the arrivals.  About an eighth of the arrivals were farmers, representing a displaced younger generation of that class.  A very small number were weavers, and among the rest were shoemakers, carpenters, tailors and blacksmiths.[^1]  

> The prevalence of labourers among the immigrants does not mean that the people were indigent.  Labouring classes going abroad were known to have had some funds.  They were, in fact, a people who made a concerted deliberate plan to move beyond the circumstances of rural Irish life.  It was the effort of a person with hope and forethought.  Emigration was an investment of unusual proportions and its significance cannot be conveyed in purely monetary terms.[^2]

> The Irish pioneering experience in British North America was not the prerogative of single men.  For Newfoundland’s fisheries and New Brunswick’s timber industry a prevalence of men was more likely, but wherever permanent agricultural settlements were to be built, Irish emigration flows were either based on family or directed at that objective.[^3]

> Only two sets of useful manifests, for ships arriving in Saint John in 1833 and 1834, have been uncovered, and they provide little more than a starting-point for pursuit of demographic and social questions about the nature of the emigrants.  No comparable set of data exists for Quebec and other ports of entry before 1860.  Although the Saint John passenger lists in 1833 and 1834 provide a valuable record of single years and single ships, they cannot give a full depiction of emigrant demography.  In particular, they underestimate the family nature of the emigration; families fractured by the departure of individual members were generally reconstituted on the North American side over a protracted period.  A husband may have gone out in one year to be followed by his wife a couple of years later.[^4]  

> The Saint John River Valley of New Brunswick created a different Irish history.  There, Protestants were more prominent and Ulster ports combined with Cork as the main source of emigrants.  New Brunswick’s variable environment gave rise to a very diverse economic character and Irish settlers were found in all economic niches, from lumber camps to mixed lumber-and-farming operations or the fewer, exclusively agricultural districts[^5]  

> Irish emigrants came largely on their own speculation to Saint John, hoping to get onto the land and re-establish lives as farmers.[^6] In 1840 the city’s Irish were probably equally divided between Catholics and Protestants.  The city acquired this unusual character because of its role not only as the principal New Brunswick port for the timber trade but as a major junction on the cheaper passenger routes to the seaboard United States.  Saint John received many emigrants destined for elsewhere and collected many people drawn by jobs or immobilized by the cost of further journeys, and in need of work.  The port provided work. After all, it was among the largest ship-building centres in the British Empire, and its hinterland offered many opportunities for work in logging camps.[^7]  

> Irish movement to the Atlantic region in the years 1831-7 was only half that going to Lower and Upper Canada.[^8] The geography of the Irish in British North America had been firmly established by the second quarter of the nineteenth century.  In fact, both ends of the country had significant Irish communities.[^9]  

> Yet, while the Irish communities in Canada ceased to be renewed by large-scale infusions of immigrants, their earlier contribution to the settlement geography of eastern and central Canada did not atrophy and disappear.  By dint of their sheer weight of numbers at an embryonic stage in Canada’s development, the Irish had made a great impact, and the surviving members of the pioneering generation and their Canadian offspring continued the mixing of Irish traditions into the new Canadian society.[^10]
