*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]].*

When my father [[(14) Frederick Francis Fitzpatrick]] passed away in 1974, the need to document the background of our family became rooted.

Adults in our families related the family stories as we were growing up but, although we were listening, the details are forgotten. Visits with [[(28i) Jessie Maitland Fitzpatrick]] and [[(28ii) Annie Catherine Fitzpatrick]] after Fredâ€™s passing, were the seeds sown that also peeked the interest of cousins Delores and Marilyn. Together, the project took on legs of its own.

In the case of the Fitzpatrick family, it was for the most part a voluntary migration from Ireland.  Most of the earliest arrivals to Canada were sons of small farmers and tradesmen,[^1] however, in the case of the first Fitzpatrick to arrive on the shores of North America, [[(112) Henry Fitzpatrick]], he was a seaman sailing from Ireland to Newfoundland. The cod industry was in decline and families moved from Newfoundland to Nova Scotia.[^2]

The marriage of [[(28) John Thomas Fitzpatrick]] to [[(29) Mary Elizabeth Bowland]] had its problems in that it was the union of Catholic and Protestant.  Both families carried bias from the homeland to Canada.  It should be noted here that the surname Bowland was also spelled Bolin, Bolen, Boland.[^3]

I cannot comprehend or imagine the hardships endured.  We do know that life was not easy even for our parents and it is with that in mind we are aware of how much we have taken for granted.
