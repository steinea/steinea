Excerpts from Cecil J. Houston and William J. Smyth's [*Irish Emigration and Canadian Settlement: Patterns, Links, and Letters*](https://utorontopress.com/9780802069108/irish-emigration-and-canadian-settlement/). Researched and collected by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]].

> Mass emigration from Ireland developed following the return of peace in 1815 (end of Napoleonic Wars) and the associated collapse of wartime agricultural prosperity.[^1] Large numbers went to Britain as seasonal harvest labourers. It was the destination of the poorest, fares only a shilling for a few hours journey by steamship.[^2]

> North America appealed to a different group. The transatlantic journey, with higher costs and a longer journey, was obviously for those with more capital. More typically, of the comfortable farming classes, they feared future loss of economic status, rather than from among those suffering from absolute penury, and were destined for life as an agricultural pioneer.[^3] As a consequence, the initial phase of emigration in 1815, 1816 and 1817, selected a small core group of relative gentility and substance. Fares were quickly and progressively reduced after 1817 and the smaller tenant farmer-cum weaver of Ulster could take advantage of the lower fares following in the wake of the better-off.[^4]

> The timing of the mass emigration thrust to Canada, its brevity, and its particular regional character distinguished it from that to the United States. Consequently, models developed in the United States for the study of the Irish abroad have only partial relevance for their Canadian counterparts. Geography and time set the two countries apart.[^5]

> Protestants were potentially more prone to respond to the disruptions by emigrating. More of them had the means and geographical mobility was more significant in their recent traditions. Throughout the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries there had been a sustained immigration to Ulster from Scotland.[^6] By way of contrast, the history of Catholic communities in Ireland was marked by a greater sense of rootedness and attachment to land. Their native identity, its never having known another place, and the limitations to movement imposed by the system of landholding. More of them were in poverty. The differential between the two became evident in the very migration streams to British North America.[^7]

> Funds to finance emigration were obtained in many ways and were required not only for passage but also to maintain immigrants on arrival in the new country, to get land, and to settle. Despite falling fares, the cost of emigration and resettlement for intending settlers rose, especially after free (but difficult to obtain) grants of land were phased out in Upper Canada in 1825 and in New Brunswick in 1827.[^8]

> Given the cost of passage and associated land settlement expenses, the earliest emigrants to Canada probably had a modest comfortable background, despite the image that has been created over the years of an exodus of indigents.[^9]

> Irish emigrants in the 1820’s were adjudged to be ‘generally of a superior description; they were men generally possessing a little property and in anything but a distressed state’; so stated by emigration agent A. C. Buchanan in Quebec. Buchanan continued, ‘Very many respectable and wealthy farmers came out this year from almost every portion of Ireland’.[^10]

> Irrespective of why people emigrated, all had to undertake a journey that until well into the second half of the nineteenth century represented a dangerous and often traumatic experience. They knew a great deal about the potential suffering and perils before embarking. They knew what sort of ships they were going on, what conditions they might expect on board and potential dangers.[^11]

> Until the mid-century advent of regular and cheap steam-passenger shipping, emigrants from Ireland journeyed on timber ships, forming a human ballast on the return trips to North American ports. Voyages could last six to ten weeks, depending on the weather, and most were undertaken in the months of April through September.[^12]

> Although conditions on board were regulated by official passenger acts, they rarely exceeded minimum standards. Shortages of clean water and food, as well as cramped quarters and pestilence, often made the journey a misery. The reputations of both captains and vessels formed part of the information relayed to intending emigrants.[^13]

> Under normal circumstances, fire, disease, and storms were the main hazards, and offshore ice was an additional peril.[^14] After weeks at sea, they arrived in the new land. For the Irish it must have been quite a shock to come face to face with land clearly surveyed. Such an arrangement of straight, unnatural lines, cutting contrary to the sweep and slopes of the natural landscape would not have been anticipated.

> Creating a farm from the wilderness could mean unremitting toil, discomfort, danger and isolation. Trees had to be felled and cleared away, crops cultivated, animals bred, and buildings erected.[^15]

> As the axe was the primary instrument of the clearing process, the felled wood was the primary material, and it served the settler in innumerable ways. Wood was used for housing, fencing, heating, tools, implements, utensils, bowls, and whatever.[^16]

> There was no chance to avoid expenses and start with nothing. Critical items had to be bought. The axe, a spade, maybe a hoe, a bit of rope, seed, and a store of food comprised the essentials of survival and much more was needed.[^17] For some, there arrival time left only a summer season to prepare. They eked out an existence in a very precarious manner; wild leeks and cow-cabbage, wild nettles, a substitute for a more substantial meal. Even recourse to supplies of wild food was at times inadequate. Whereas the people in one area would be well fed, others would be hungry less than thirty miles away in a newer settlement district.[^18]

> Cropping experience from home was applied with great caution. Winter grains were risky and in some places impossible. In Upper Canada, wheat was adopted as a commercial crop. The crops were familiar to the immigrants, but new modes of cultivation had to be developed, usually being copied from the patterns of earlier arrived settlers. For example, leaving potatoes and root crops in the ground until needed, as was possible in Ireland, was disastrous in British North America where in the depth of winter, frost could reach -20 degrees Celsius regularly with snow accumulations to a depth of four feet or more.[^19]

> Building a house was often a settler’s first mark of permanence on his lot. Generally the first dwelling would be constructed of logs, a crude single-storey structure with an open fireplace and rude chimney. Despite all the draughts, its two rooms made a definite improvement over a shanty or tent. A wood frame-house with clapboard siding would have represented a further improvement on the original crude log structure and was generally as much as could be undertaken in the first, immigrant generation.[^20]

> Rural localities acquired the look of permanence when churches, schools and community halls were built. For Protestants, Orange halls were the landscape indicators of their particular Irish outlook. Often the Orange Lodge had a building before the Church congregation did.[^21]

> Growth of towns marked the maturing phase of Canadian settlement.[^22] Railways heralded the rise of an urban phase and the decline of a rural-dominated pioneering phase. In announcing the arrival of industrialism, the railways also signaled the virtual end of pioneering in central and eastern Canada and coincidentally the end of the great Irish emigration to Canada.[^23]
