Currently, I am working on preproduction for *FC 25*, reading Jordan's *The Fires of Heaven* and Zola's *Germinal*, teaching GAME 260: Project Management for Video Games, preparing to teach GAME 340: Advanced Game Design, trying to finish my essay series on Deleuze's *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, and cleaning up the website and my repository of projects.
