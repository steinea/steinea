* [Deleuze and Guattari](/work/projects/deleuze-and-guattari)
* [Samuel Beckett](/work/projects/samuel-beckett)
* [Ã‰mile Zola](/work/projects/emile-zola)
* [Irish history and language](/work/projects/irish-history-and-language)
* [Shakespeare's history plays](/work/projects/shakespeares-history-plays)
* [Merleau-Ponty and enaction](/work/projects/merleau-ponty-and-enaction)
* [The Last of Us and interpretation](/work/projects/what-i-had-to-do)
* [FromSoftware and archives](/work/projects/the-dukes-archives)
