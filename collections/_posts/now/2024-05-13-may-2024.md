Right now, I am...
* Supporting the FC Gameplay team as we approach Alpha on *FC 25*
* Preparing to travel to Germany for the international conference on [Agency, Analog Tabletop Role-Playing Games, and Asymmetrical Dependency](https://www.fiw.uni-bonn.de/en/news/international-conference-on-agency-analog-tabletop-role-playing-games-and-asymmetrical-dependency) at the Bonn Lab for Analog Games and Imaginative Play
* Continuing work on my CGSA paper on *Starfield*
* Starting work on the panel on hopepunk in ttrpgs that I am facilitating at Generation Analog 2024
* Collating my reading notes on Emily St. John Mandel's *The Glass Hotel* and *Sea of Tranquility*
* Reading *2001: A Space Odyssey*
* Watching *Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury*
* Migrating my website from both the GitLab and Obsidian versions to SourceHut
* Getting ready to study for my PMP
* And really, truly, I promise, envisioning how I might possibly, somehow, finally finish my essay series on *Empiricism and Subjectivity*
