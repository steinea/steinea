*Earth Without Us* is a 12-page zine based on Lukáš Likavčan's *Introduction to Comparative Planetology* (Strelka Press, 2019). It takes his concluding five instructions for an "infrastructural geopolitics of climate emergency" and converts them into a "geoludics," a simple worldbuilding exercise with the goal of generating a real planetary praxis.

All quotations are from Likavčan's work, without which this zine could not have been made. If you find this interesting, get a copy of his book [here](https://www.likavcan.com/articles/introduction-to-comparative-planetology).
