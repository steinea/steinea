This zine refuses naive understandings of play as intrinsically liberatory or radical.

As work beyond law, beyond control, beyond empire, non-play is a *destituent* labour, effort by way of the direct mobilization of the rule.

Inspired by Hugh Farrell’s essay for *Ill Will*, “[The Strategy of Composition](https://illwill.com/composition),” and the land defenders of whom he writes, this zine channels the “possibility of revolutionary organization” that we see erupting in the midst of such contested spaces as Standing Rock, Lützerath, and the Atlanta Forest.

Written for the [Radical Futures](https://itch.io/jam/radical-futures) jam.
