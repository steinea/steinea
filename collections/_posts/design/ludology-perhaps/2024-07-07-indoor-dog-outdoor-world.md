This is a magical tabletop roleplaying game for a handful of adventurers and one adventurous dog.

Version 0.1 is the ashcan edition.

This game takes Into the Odd by Chris McDowall and Lasers & Feelings by John Harper, and asks, what if we played both of these games at once?

*Cover art is "White Poodle in a Punt" by George Stubbs from the National Gallery of Art.*
