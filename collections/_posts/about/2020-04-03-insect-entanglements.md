I am a game designer ([itch.io](https://vagrantludology.itch.io/)), games researcher ([Academia](https://twu.academia.edu/steinea)), and part-time instructor at TWU, where I teach humanities for our international cohort and interactive storytelling in the games program. I use the tools of literary theory and phenomenology to interpret the varied meanings of video games---especially those developed by FromSoftware---and their material effects in and upon the lives of their players. My design work primarily operates in the tabletop roleplaying space, where I enjoys bringing together philosophy and play, and introducing players to story and free-form roleplaying systems.
