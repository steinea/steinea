I am a game designer and developer, an instructor of game development, and a game studies researcher. With a background in literature and philosophy, my primary interests in games are the domains of interactive storytelling and narrative design, with a special interest in the mechanics of drama.

I am a [Certified Associate in Project Management](https://www.projectmanagement.com/profile/steinea/) and work as an [Associate Development Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steinea/) at Electronic Arts in Vancouver. My first AAA title was [*EA Sports FIFA 23*](https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/fifa-23). I am currently supporting the Connected Modes team in the development of [*EA Sports FC 24*](https://www.ea.com/news/ea-sports-fc). I was hired as part of the Future Prospects Development Director program in 2021, and I have been privileged to be able to give back through contributions to the development of project management learning materials within the organization, and through participation in panel conversations about project management and the games industry with students from [BCIT](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bitman-association_thank-you-to-our-amazing-panelists-from-ea-activity-6902419016116252672-cY79/) and Douglas College.

I have been designing tabletop roleplaying games since 2019, and facilitating tabletop rpgs since 2009. I have an extensive back catalog of free, experimental games that can be downloaded at [itch.io](https://vagrantludology.itch.io/). I have also successfully ran Kickstarter campaigns for print editions of two of these projects, [*Lost Scriptures*](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vagrantludology/lost-scriptures) and [*Glitchspiel*](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vagrantludology/glitchspiel). I have participated in numerous game jams, and helped [organize](https://itch.io/jams/hosted-by-vagrantludology) two myself: the [Intergalactic Memorial Carnival](https://itch.io/jam/intergalactic-memorial-carnival) and the [Applied Hope: Solarpunk and Utopias Jam](https://itch.io/jam/applied-hope).

I teach a variety of courses in game development at [Trinity Western University](https://www.twu.ca/profile/eric-stein). This semester, I am teaching Video Game Aesthetics and Game Development Project II/III. In previous semesters, I have taught Introduction to Game Design, Game Design for Video Games, Advanced Game Design, Project Management for Game Development, Game Development Project I, and Interactive Storytelling. I have also supervised several students during their Field Placement courses, in which they develop professional skills and gain real world experience in the games industry. As well, I helped coordinate our inaugural high school game jam, wherein our game development majors partnered with local secondary students to help them build their first playable games in Unity. Finally, I created and maintain our program Discord server, where I operate as admin and de facto community manager.

I have conducted extensive research on FromSoftware's oeuvre, from *Demon's Souls* to the present, with two papers on *Elden Ring* forthcoming this year. I have also presented research on Naughty Dog's [*The Last of Us*](https://zenodo.org/record/4603470) and [*The Last of Us Part II*](https://zenodo.org/record/4603514), Cardboard Computer's [*Kentucky Route Zero*](https://zenodo.org/record/4603525), and Team Cherry's [*Hollow Knight*](https://zenodo.org/record/4603508). Additionally, I have an interest in the study of tabletop games, and have conducted research on Avery Alder and Benjamin Rosenbaum's [*Dream Askew / Dream Apart*](https://zenodo.org/record/5156494), Jesse Ross's [*Trophy Dark*](https://zenodo.org/record/6932651), and the broad movement of [lyric games](https://zenodo.org/record/4824078).

I live and work in [ch'atlich](https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/73681.html) on the traditional, unceded swiya of the [shíshálh](https://shishalh.com/) nation.
