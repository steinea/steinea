My work is all things games. I am a [Development Director](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steinea/) at Electronic Arts, leading the Game Modes team on *EA SPORTS FC*. As a project manager, I am interested in mutualist and ecological theories of management and organization, with cooperative principles forming the basis of my approach to team leadership and game production. I am also a [Game Development Instructor](https://www.twu.ca/profile/eric-stein) at Trinity Western University, where I have taught for several years, covering such diverse topics as project management, interactive storytelling, and videogame aesthetics. My [scholarly background](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4131-2695) is in literature and game studies, with my academic work focusing on the philosophy of games and play, gameplay dynamics, and narrative design. Finally, I maintain a creative and critical writing practice, ranging across theory, poetry, and game design. Available works can be found here on my [blog](/blog), in my [collections](/collections), and on my [CV](/cv).
