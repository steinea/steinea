Hello, world! I am a game [producer](https://linkedin.com/in/steinea/ "LinkedIn"), [publisher](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/vagrantludology/created "Kickstarter"), [designer](https://steinea.itch.io/ "itch.io"), and [researcher](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4131-2695 "ORCID"), located in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia. I work and live on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the Stó꞉lō, Mathxwí, Semá:th, and Kwantlen First Nations. This website is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/ "Maggie Appleton"), my [memex](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/about.html "Devine Lu Linvega"), or perhaps most apt, given my interests, my [thought cabinet](https://discoelysium.fandom.com/wiki/Thought_Cabinet "Disco Elysium").

For the last several years I have worked at Electronic Arts as a Development Director, performing project management and people leadership duties across the delivery of three shipped AAA titles: [EA SPORTS™ FIFA 23](https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/fifa-23), [EA SPORTS FC™ 24](https://www.ea.com/en-au/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-24), and [EA SPORTS FC™ 25](https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25). At present, I am working on EA SPORTS FC™ 26 and am in the process of transitioning into a new role as a Producer, in which I will be operating as a program manager driving several large scale technical initiatives focused on product quality. My responsibilities in this new job function can be summarized as *production architecture*, *organisation design*, *business transformation*, and *operational excellence*, with a remit encompassing design, product, project, and engineering.

From 2020 to 2025 I taught in the [Game Development](https://www.twu.ca/academics/school-arts-media-culture/game-development) program at Trinity Western University, where I was responsible for developing course materials, teaching undergraduate students from first year to fourth year, and providing field placement supervision, professional coaching, and skills training to students embarking on the first steps of their game development careers. In my five years as an educator I developed and taught courses in game design, interactive storytelling, video game aesthetics, game production, and project management, building out a curriculum with a unique mix of practical and theoretical approaches to the art and craft of game development.

I hold an MA in [Interdisciplinary Humanities](https://www.twu.ca/academics/school-graduate-studies/interdisciplinary-humanities-ma) from TWU (2018), and a BA Honours in [English Literature](https://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2016/spring/programs/english/honours/bachelor-of-arts.html) and Certificate in [Creative Writing](https://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2016/spring/programs/creative-writing/certificate.html) from SFU (2016). At SFU, I wrote my honours thesis on law and violence in Melville's *Billy Budd, Sailor*. At TWU, I wrote my master's thesis in philosophy of technology and narrative theory, unpacking the problematic of the cyborg in the tradition of western metaphysics. Both theses were recognized for academic excellence, for which I received the [Philippa Polson Prize](https://www.sfu.ca/english/undergraduate/funding/by-nomination.html) at SFU and the Humanities Award at TWU.

Since defending my master's thesis, I have conducted numerous qualitative research studies on narrative and games, employing the phenomenological, hermeneuetical, and poststructural methods of my academic training to undertake mechanical close readings of video games like [*Kentucky Route Zero*](/2021/03/12/its-more-like-a-tendency/), [*Hollow Knight*](2020/06/19/pure-vessels/), [*The Last of Us*](/2020/08/28/it-cant-be-for-nothing/), and FromSoftware's oeuvre from [*Demon's Souls*](/2020/10/23/the-dark-sigil-will-guide-thee/) to [*Elden Ring*](/2023/06/06/beasts-and-sovereigns/), as well as tabletop games like [*Dream Askew / Dream Apart*](/2021/08/05/no-dice-no-masters/) and [*Trophy Dark*](/2022/07/28/play-to-lose/). I have presented this research at conferences such as the Canadian Game Studies Association conference, the International Conference on Games and Narrative, and Generation Analog.

I have published numerous tabletop roleplaying game zines on [itch.io](https://steinea.itch.io/) as part of an ongoing critical design and research-creation practice, including two---[*Lost Scriptures*](2020/02/26/lost-scriptures/) and [*Glitchspiel*](2021/02/02/glitchspiel/)---which I successfully crowdfunded during Kickstarter's Zine Quest in 2020 and 2021. I have also published two chapbooks of poetry---*On the Back of a Tiger* and *Stratum of Choice*---and my first full length trade collection, *The Deep*, is in submission.

I received my [CAPM](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/certified-associate-capm) from PMI in 2021 and upgraded this designation to the [PMP](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp) in 2024. I am a [member](/affiliations/) in good standing of the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences, the Canadian Game Studies Association, the International Game Developers Association, the Project Management Institute, and the Tabletop Game Designers Association. My professional work is indebted to Marxist sociologist Erik Olin Wright’s writing on organization in his 1985 book [*Classes*](/erik-olin-wright-classes/), which I consider required reading for all with socialist inclinations who are employed in the games industry.
