Eric Stein is a game designer ([itch.io](https://vagrantludology.itch.io/)) and games researcher ([Academia](https://twu.academia.edu/steinea)) who teaches in the Foundations and Game Development programs at Trinity Western University. His research uses the tools of literary theory and phenomenology to interpret the varied meanings of video games---especially those developed by FromSoftware---and their material  effects  in  and  upon the  lives  of  their  players.  His  design  work  primarily  operates  in  the  tabletop  roleplaying  space,  where  he  enjoys  bringing  together  philosophy and  play,  and  introducing  players  to  story  and  free-form roleplaying systems.
