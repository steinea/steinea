I am an [Associate Development Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steinea/) on the FIFA Gameplay Team at Electronic Arts, supporting our developers in bringing the best football video game in the world to life. I am also a [Game Development Instructor](https://www.twu.ca/profile/eric-stein) at Trinity Western University, training the next generation of developers in the skills, ideas, and mentalities they will need to excel in the games industry and transform it for the better.

I have a background in [academic game studies](https://steinea.github.io/works/), focusing on the philosophy of games and play, gameplay dynamics, and narrative design. I got my start making analog games, self-publishing roleplaying game zines on [itch.io](https://vagrantludology.itch.io/), and running two successful [crowdfunding campaigns](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/vagrantludology/created) for Kickstarter's Zine Quest. This led to me teaching game design and development and serving as a project manager for student projects.

I am passionate about the intersection of industry and education, and care deeply about the labour that goes into making the interactive entertainment that I love. It takes an enormous amount of talent and effort to make a video game, and getting to collaborate with a team of amazing people to that end is an incredible privilege.
