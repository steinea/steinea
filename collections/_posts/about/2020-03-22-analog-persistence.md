Eric Stein is a games scholar and game designer working and living in British Columbia’s Fraser Valley, where he is also a part-time instructor at Trinity Western University. His scholarship is concerned with the intersection of philosophy, technology, and games, with a concentration on FromSoftware’s *Souls* games, their progenitors, and their inheritors. His design work primarily operates in the tabletop roleplaying space, with his most recent project, *Lost Scriptures*, doubling its funding goal for Kickstarter’s Zine Quest 2 in March 2020.
