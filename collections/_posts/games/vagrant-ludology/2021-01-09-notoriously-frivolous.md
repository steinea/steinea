*Notoriously Frivolous* is a game in conversation with David Graeber's essay, "[What's the Point if We Can't Have Fun?](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/whats-the-point-if-we-cant-have-fun)" It employs concrete modes of play to engage with Graeber's conception of a principle of "ludic freedom."

In the spirit of the [Intergalactic Memorial Carnival](https://itch.io/jam/intergalactic-memorial-carnival), for which this was written, *Notoriously Frivolous* is in A5 zine format and is meant to be printed and shared. As with all my zines, it should easily print on letter-sized paper if you select the "booklet" option in your printer settings.
