*Stay* is a game for Ellie and Dina, for solidarity, and for my heart. It is about belonging and obsession, protagonists and heroes, and what it means to remain.

*Stay* is a one move subsystem that you can hack into a ttrpg of your choice or use for solo or social play as a system in itself.

*Stay* is a game about the ones we choose.
