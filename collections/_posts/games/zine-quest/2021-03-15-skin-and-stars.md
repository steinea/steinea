This is a game of the body cosmic. It is a hack of John Harper’s [*Lasers & Feelings*](https://johnharper.itch.io/lasers-feelings), with inspiration from Ben Roswell’s [*War in the Year 3000*](https://roswellian.itch.io/war-in-the-year-3000) and Sundae Month’s [*Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor*](https://tinybuild.itch.io/diaries-of-a-spaceport-janitor).

*Skin & Stars* is a rules-lite adaptation of my own rules-free [*Glitchspiel*](https://vagrantludology.itch.io/glitchspiel), proposing one potential framework for the tactics included therein. As with *Glitchspiel*, this game would not exist without Legacy Russell’s manifesto, [*Glitch Feminism*](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3668-glitch-feminism). All quotations in the game are from that text.

In *Skin & Stars*, you play as cosmorgs: future subjectivities existing beyond the old and forgotten forms of earth-bound humanity. You eat, you love, you die, just as the meat-beings did before you. But unlike the meat-beings, your existence is marked by vastness, diffusion, abstraction, a fulfillment of that which was once only a possibility.

*Skin & Stars* is laid out as a z-folding pamphlet, printable on letter-sized paper. The cover and background image is NASA's [XDF](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/xdf.html).
