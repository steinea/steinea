<br>

### 1: Intellection (*Strategic Thinking*)

#### How You Can Thrive

You are characterized by your intellectual activity. You are introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions.

<br>

#### Why Your Intellection is Unique

*These personalized Strengths Insights are specific to your CliftonStrengths results.*

Because of your strengths, you prepare for important conversations or discussions by collecting lots of background information. It is not unusual for you to set aside at least five hours of quiet time each week to consider what you have discovered. You are likely to use this time to expand your thinking. A new piece of material can send you hunting for additional evidence to support your theories, concepts, or proposals.

It’s very likely that you really like to read about past events and the key people involved. By accumulating lots of knowledge regarding days gone by, you regularly anticipate the opportunities and pitfalls you are apt to face in the coming months, years, or decades.

Driven by your talents, you find it easier to befriend people when they tell you what they want to accomplish. Knowing that much, you probably read books, journals, newspapers, correspondence, or Internet sites to broaden your knowledge about their interests. When you can share information that helps people move closer to their goals, you understand each other better.

Instinctively, you absorb the written word like a sponge sops up water. You revel in an opportunity to lose yourself in a book. Time seems to float by when you are the grateful guest of an entertaining or informative author. Your only choice is to finish the book as quickly as possible.

Chances are good that you think carefully about weighty matters. You enjoy reflecting on the people and/or circumstances in your life. You rely less on emotion and more on logic to draw reasonable conclusions. Simply put: You tend to use your mind rather than your heart when making critical judgments. You are quite comfortable being alone with your thoughts. You have little need to be constantly surrounded by talkative people.

<br>

#### Why You Succeed Using Intellection

You love to think, muse and reflect. Your powerful mental processing and intellectual activity empower you to clarify and explain, regardless of the topic or situation.

<br>

#### Take Action to Maximize Your Potential

*Think deeply. Think often.*

* Set aside a few minutes every day to collect your thoughts. This reflection time will energize you, and your thinking will become sharper and more effective.
* Get involved in big projects or initiatives in the early stages, before the action begins. You have the ability to follow a trail to see where it leads, and your insights enable projects to move forward intelligently and without backtracking.
* Take time to write. Writing might be the best way to crystallize and integrate your thoughts. Make a list of your best ideas, and refer to it often. Revisiting your thoughts can give you valuable insights.
* Give people time to think through the thoughts and ideas you present. Remember that they have not spent as much time as you have pondering, so they might not grasp your message right away.
* Deliberately build relationships with people you consider to be “big thinkers.” Their example will inspire you to focus your own thinking.

<br>

#### Watch Out for Blind Spots

* Because you are comfortable with silence and solitude, others might view you as isolated, disinterested or disengaged. Be prepared to tell them that solitary thinking is just your natural process and not necessarily a reflection of how much you care.
* Some people might think you create needless complexity during discussions and may want you to make decisions faster than you do. Consider tailoring your approach; sometimes it’s better to keep it simple and go more in depth later.

<br>

### 2: Input (*Strategic Thinking*)

#### How You Can Thrive

You have a need to collect and archive. You may accumulate information, ideas, artifacts or even relationships.

<br>

#### Why Your Input is Unique

*These personalized Strengths Insights are specific to your CliftonStrengths results.*

Instinctively, you approach your studies or work with dignity and in a businesslike manner. It makes perfect sense, therefore, that you possess a vocabulary rich in complicated, technical, or subject-specific words. You habitually take time to carefully think through whatever you are going to say or write before you begin. Once you have identified your main theories or concepts, you can express them with clarity and precision.

Because of your strengths, you feast on the ideas in books and other printed material. In the process of reading, you accumulate lots of information for its own sake. During the week, you likely spend several hours reflecting on your treasure trove of facts, data, history, or research.
Often one or two of your newfound concepts, theories, or findings consumes the majority of your thinking time.

Driven by your talents, you pay close attention to intelligent conversations. You have a knack for giving credit to individuals who make key points that advance everyone’s understanding of a theory, concept, or idea. You file away or make a mental note about this information, knowing it will be useful one day.

Chances are good that you are drawn to the process of gaining knowledge and skills. You long to build on what you already know. You yearn to improve on what you already can do. When you meet people who value education as much as you do, you are eager to hear about their personal or professional ambitions, intentions, or goals. Understanding what others aim to accomplish in the coming weeks, months, or years can be the beginning of a practical partnership or an enduring friendship.

By nature, you are more comfortable talking about ideas than issuing orders or dealing with conflict. You gravitate to conversations with intelligent people. You intentionally cast aside emotions and concentrate on the facts. You continually search for evidence to make your points and wish others would do the same.

<br>

#### Why You Succeed Using Input

You seek and store information. Your pursuit of mastery and access to knowledge empowers you to make credible and well-informed decisions.

<br>

#### Take Action to Maximize Your Potential

*Keep exploring; always be curious.*

* Find out more about areas you want to specialize in. Consider jobs or volunteer opportunities where you can acquire and share information every day, such as teaching, journalism or research work.
* Regularly read books and articles that motivate you. Increase your vocabulary by collecting new words and learning their meaning.
* Devise a system to store and easily locate information you have found so you can access it quickly. Use whatever approach works best for you — a file for articles you have saved, a database or spreadsheet, or a list of your favorite websites.
* Position yourself as an expert. Share your exceptional archive of facts, data and ideas with others when they need help or advice.
* Seek out subject-matter experts who would be interested in knowing what you are learning and who would find it stimulating to hear about the questions and ideas you generate through your exploration.

<br>

#### Watch Out for Blind Spots

* Unrestrained input can lead to intellectual or physical clutter. Consider occasionally taking inventory and purging what you don’t need so that your surroundings — and your mind — don’t become overloaded.
* You might have a tendency to give people so much information or so many resources that you can overload and overwhelm them. Before you share your discoveries with others, consider sorting out what is most meaningful so they don’t lose interest.

<br>

### 3: Learner (*Strategic Thinking*)

#### How You Can Thrive

You have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. The process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites you.

<br>

#### Why Your Learner is Unique

*These personalized Strengths Insights are specific to your CliftonStrengths results.*

It’s very likely that you absorb all sorts of information from books, publications, or other written materials. You display a voracious — that is, never fully satisfied — appetite for knowledge. You devour the written word to savor useful facts. For you, a great day is one during which you have added new insights to your mind’s storehouse of ideas.

Chances are good that you frequently examine the factors leading up to an event. Therein you discover the reasons why things happened the way they did. A number of individuals and/or groups probably appreciate your logical thinking style.

Instinctively, you earnestly direct your attention toward the ideas, issues, situations, or possibilities that stir your curiosity. In fact, you devote more time than most people do to exploring topics, problems, prospects, opportunities, or techniques that pique — that is, arouse or excite — your interest. When something has to be completed, you are eager to acquire the necessary knowledge or skills to meet the challenge.

Driven by your talents, you enjoy reflecting on what you already know and on what you want to know. Your concentration leads you to major and minor discoveries. You need ample quiet time to critically examine new information, theories, concepts, or philosophies. Wherever you go and whatever you do, your mind is seldom at rest. You consider what you have observed. You pose never-before-asked questions. Thinking deeply about things is a necessity for you. It is not a luxury. It is not an option.

Because of your strengths, you thirst for new ideas and knowledge. Often you lose yourself in a book. You pore over the ideas contained on its pages for long stretches of time. Why? You want to absorb as much information as you can.

<br>

#### Why You Succeed Using Learner

You love to learn, and you intuitively know how you learn best. Your natural ability to pick up and absorb information quickly and to challenge yourself to continually learn more keeps you on the cutting edge.

<br>

#### Take Action to Maximize Your Potential

*Use your passion for learning to add value to your own and others’ lives.*

* Become an early adopter of new technology, and keep your coworkers, friends and family informed. You learn quickly, and others will appreciate when you share and explain cutting-edge developments to them.
* Respect your desire to learn. Take advantage of educational opportunities in your community or at work. Discipline yourself to sign up for at least one new course or class each year.
* Find opportunities to expand your knowledge. Take on increasingly difficult topics, courses or projects. You love the challenge of a steep learning curve, so beware of learning plateaus.
* Be a catalyst for change. New rules, skills or circumstances might intimidate others. Your willingness to absorb new and different factors can calm their fears.
* Keep track of your learning progress. If a skill or topic has distinct levels or stages of learning, celebrate your progression from one level to the next. If not, create them for yourself. For example, set a goal of reading five books on a new subject.

<br>

#### Watch Out for Blind Spots

* You place a high value on learning and studying, and you may tend to impose this value on others. Be sure to respect others’ motivations, and resist pushing them toward learning for learning’s sake.
* You love the process of learning so much that the outcome might not matter to you. Be careful not to let the process of knowledge acquisition get in the way of your results and productivity.

<br>

### 4: Connectedness (*Relationship Building*)

#### How You Can Thrive

You have faith in the links among all things. You believe there are few coincidences and that almost every event has meaning.

#### Why Your Connectedness is Unique

*These personalized Strengths Insights are specific to your CliftonStrengths results.*

Driven by your talents, you sense that everything in life is somehow interrelated and interdependent. This idea steels — that is, fortifies — you to calmly face most of life’s challenges and difficulties.

Chances are good that you underscore what people have in common even though their backgrounds, experiences, languages, cultures, or interests vary greatly. You facilitate dialogue between individuals. You create peace within groups and between people by linking them to one another.

Instinctively, you may be able to accept unpredictable events in your life on the basis of sheer faith. Perhaps you sense there is a force greater than you at work in the world. Occasionally you can live with not knowing the exact reason why something good or bad happened to you and not to someone else.

Because of your strengths, you continually seek wisdom from people with whom you have intelligent conversations. You not only listen but also share your thoughts. In the process, you are likely to move beyond concrete facts. Your curiosity draws you to speculate — that is, reflect or wonder — about theories, ideas, or concepts. To keep your mind fresh, you frequently quiz individuals who are equally fascinated with the intangible and abstract aspects of life.

It’s very likely that you are determined to know a lot about the individuals you identify as seekers of truth. You are attracted to people who ponder weighty philosophical questions such as “What is the meaning of life?” or “What is beauty?” or “What constitutes wisdom?” or “Why do bad things happen to good people?” or “Why should ordinary people like me even ask these kinds of questions?”

<br>

#### Why You Succeed Using Connectedness

You build bridges between people and groups. You help others find meaning by looking at the bigger picture of the world around them, and you give them a sense of comfort and stability in the face of uncertainty.

<br>

#### Take Action to Maximize Your Potential

*Help others see connections and purpose in everyday life.*

* Use your sense of connection to build the foundation for strong relationships. When you meet new people, ask them questions to find common ground and shared interests that you can use as a starting point.
* Consider roles in which you listen to and counsel others. You could become an expert at helping people see connections and purpose in everyday occurrences.
* Help those around you cope with unpredictable and unexplainable events. Your perspective will bring them comfort.
* Show your friends and coworkers how they are connected to those around them. Point out specific examples of how their actions directly and indirectly affect others.
* Help your teammates and colleagues better understand how their efforts fit into the bigger picture. When people see that what they are doing is important and part of something larger than themselves, they will be more committed to the goal, and your team will be stronger.

<br>

#### Watch Out for Blind Spots

* You may react more calmly and passively to others’ bad news, frustrations or concerns than they would like. Be aware that people sometimes need to vent and will want you to validate their feelings more than they want a philosophical response.
* Some may perceive you as naïve or idealistic because turmoil and upheaval likely trouble you. Remember that not everyone shares your connected

<br>

### 5: Strategic (*Strategic Thinking*)

#### How You Can Thrive

You create alternative ways to proceed. Faced with any given scenario, you can quickly spot the relevant patterns and issues.

<br>

#### Why Your Strategic is Unique

*These personalized Strengths Insights are specific to your CliftonStrengths results.*

Because of your strengths, you occasionally aim for the topmost title or prize. With some forethought, perhaps you generate alternate tactics. Your options may give you an edge over people whose performances or results are being compared to yours.

Driven by your talents, you analyze the lessons of the past to find clues for handling future situations. Piecing together the causes and effects of historical events allows you to discover alternate routes to your goal. You are seldom taken by surprise. Why? You probably have studied your options and crafted innovative solutions.

Instinctively, you may generate numerous ways to enhance, upgrade, revise, correct, or revamp certain processes, action plans, or itineraries. Sometimes your suggestions influence how a project will unfold in the coming months, years, or decades. You might find fault with your own or another person’s talents, skills, or knowledge. To some extent, fixing people or things ranks in the top half of your list of favorite activities.

Chances are good that you examine the past. You discover why things happened. This permits you to foresee the future. You study humankind’s story to identify subtle nuances, recurring sequences of events, and predictable human behavior. Generating clever, resourceful, inventive, and original alternatives, you can offer solutions to age-old problems.

It’s very likely that you may notice that multiple solutions to nagging problems just pop into your mind. Sometimes you study each option from many different angles. Perhaps you carefully evaluate the entire situation, then choose the alternative that makes the most sense. Why? Maybe you aim to outscore or outperform your rivals.

<br>

#### Why You Succeed Using Strategic

You quickly weigh alternative paths and determine the best one. Your natural ability to anticipate, play out different scenarios and plan ahead makes you an agile decision-maker.

<br>

#### Take Action to Maximize Your Potential

*Always have at least three options in mind so you can adapt if circumstances change.*

* Strengthen the groups you belong to by using your talent to discover the best path to success. Because you can do this quickly, it may look as if you are “winging it,” so explain yourself along the way to help others understand what you see.
* Schedule time each day to think about your goals and strategies. Time alone might be the best way for you to evaluate all your options and to find the right course of action for each goal.
* Trust your insights. Because you consider options so naturally and easily, you might not realize how you came up with a strategy. But because of your exceptional talents, it will likely be successful.
* Find a group that does important work, and contribute your strategic thinking. Your ideas and expert planning can make you a strong leader in any group.
* Be prepared to explain your thought process; sometimes people can misinterpret your Strategic talents as criticism of their ideas. Help them understand that, instead, you are considering what is already working well and what others have already done.

<br>

#### Watch Out for Your Blindspots

* When working with others, sometimes they may misinterpret your strong Strategic talents as criticism. Be mindful of what is already working well and what others have accomplished.
* Because you evaluate patterns and pathways so quickly, others might find it difficult to follow or understand your thought process. Be aware that sometimes, you might have to backtrack to explain how you got to where you are.

<br>

### 6: Achiever (*Executing*)

#### How You Can Thrive

You work hard and possess a great deal of stamina. You take immense satisfaction in being busy and productive.

<br>

#### Why You Succeed Using Achiever

You love to complete tasks, and your accomplishments fulfill you. You have a strong inner drive — an innate source of intensity, energy and power that motivates you to work hard to get things done.

<br>

#### Take Action to Maximize Your Potential

*Bring intensity and effort to the most important areas of your life.*

* Set challenging goals. Take advantage of your self-motivation with a more ambitious goal every time you finish a project.
* Take time to celebrate each success before moving on to your next item or task, even for just a few minutes.
* Limit your commitments to projects or assignments that align with your highest priorities as much as you can.

<br>

#### Watch Out for Blind Spots

* You might get frustrated when others don’t work as hard as you do, and they might see you as too demanding. Remember that not everyone has the same high expectations for themselves or is driven to work as hard as you are.
* Your pressing need to get things done might cause you to take on projects or agree to deadlines before you know everything that’s involved. Before you commit to something, make sure you have the time and resources you need to do it right.

<br>

### 7: Ideation (*Strategic Thinking*)

#### How You Can Thrive

You are fascinated by ideas. You are able to find connections between seemingly disparate phenomena.

<br>

#### Why You Succeed Using Ideation

You are fascinated by ideas. Because you enjoy looking at the world from different perspectives and are always searching for connections, you are a powerful and creative brainstorming partner.

<br>

#### Take Action to Maximize Your Potential

*Refine your creativity to inspire and energize yourself and others.*

* Make small changes in your work or home routines. Experiment. Play mental games with yourself. You likely get bored quickly, so these adjustments can keep you engaged.
* Take time to read, explore and think. Others’ ideas and experiences can energize you and help you form new ideas.
* Understand the fuel for your Ideation talents. When do you get your best ideas? When you’re talking with people? When you’re reading? When you’re simply listening or observing? Identify the circumstances when you get your best ideas so you can recreate them.

<br>

#### Watch Out for Blind Spots

* Your limitless thoughts and ideas can sometimes overwhelm and confuse people. Consider refining your ideas and sharing only the best so others won’t reject them simply because they cannot follow your abstract thinking.
* You might struggle to follow through on the ideas you generate. Think about collaborating with someone who can help you turn your best ideas into real results.

<br>

### 8: Context (*Strategic Thinking*)

#### How You Can Thrive

You enjoy thinking about the past. You understand the present by researching its history.

<br>

#### Why You Succeed Using Context

You look to history to understand the present. Your distinctive ability to see the link between where you have been and where you are going is extremely valuable for planning and decision-making.

<br>

#### Take Action to Maximize Your Potential

*Look to the past to build a better tomorrow.*

* Help your school, team or organization strengthen its culture via folklore. For example, collect symbols and stories about the past, or suggest naming an award after someone you can memorialize for their contributions.
* Find a mentor who has lived in your community or worked in your organization for a long time. Listening to this person’s experiences will likely spark your thought process and accelerate your learning.
* Study your past successes. Try to identify the specific actions or behaviors that contributed to them so you can draw on them again.

<br>

#### Watch Out for Blind Spots

* Some people might think that you live in the past and are resistant to change. Consider explaining the value of understanding history and what has — and has not — worked in the past, but keep an open mind when new situations arise.
* You are often fascinated by history and the lessons it reveals, but others may find this information boring or overwhelming. Keep this in mind as you share your perspectives, and look for signs that you’ve lost people’s attention or interest.

<br>

### 9: Relator (*Relationship Building*)

#### How You Can Thrive

You enjoy close relationships with others. You find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal.

<br>

#### Why You Succeed Using Relator

You naturally form genuine and mutually rewarding one-on-one relationships. Your authenticity allows you to build close, long-lasting connections that foster trust and confidence.

<br>

#### Take Action to Maximize Your Potential

*Connect deeply with the right people to gain friends for life.*

* Try to get one-on-one time with people, rather than attempting to connect with them in a group. This will help you build the deeper and trusting relationships you value most.
* Stay in contact with your friends, no matter how busy you are. Your closest relationships energize you.
* Make sure people know that you are more interested in their character and personality than in their status or job title. You might serve as a model for others.

<br>

#### Watch Out for Blind Spots

* Because Relators typically do not trust others implicitly and people have to earn your trust over time, some may think you are hard to get to know. Be aware of this perception with new people you meet as well as with the people you see every day.
* Your tendency to spend more time with the people you know best might give the impression that you are exclusive or unfriendly to those outside your inner circle. Consider that you might be missing out on the benefits of widening the circle and getting to know more people.

<br>

### 10: Analytical (*Strategic Thinking*)

#### How You Can Thrive

You search for reasons and causes. You have the ability to think about all of the factors that might affect a situation.

<br>

#### Why You Succeed Using Analytical

Your natural ability to investigate, diagnose and identify patterns results in valuable insights that are logical and well-thought-out. Your critical thinking helps clarify reality and provides objectivity.

<br>

#### Take Action to Maximize Your Potential

*Use your logical, objective approach to make important decisions.*

* Identify credible sources you can rely on. Find helpful books, websites, experts or other resources that you can use as references.
* Get involved in the planning stages of a new initiative or project so you can evaluate its feasibility and direction before it gets too far along.
* Accept that sometimes you will need to take action before all the facts are in place.

<br>

#### Watch Out for Blind Spots

* Your objective and fact-based approach to decision-making may seem skeptical or critical. Keep in mind that others will have emotional, subjective and personal opinions — and that their input is just as valuable as yours is.
* Because you ask many questions, people may think that you always doubt the validity of their ideas, that you do not trust them and that you are tough to work with. Explain your analysis so they will be more likely to trust your process and your motives.

<br>

## Navigate the Rest of Your CliftonStrengths

Your greatest opportunity to reach your full potential is developing and using your strongest CliftonStrengths. But it is also important to understand all 34 of your CliftonStrengths themes.

**Your unique CliftonStrengths 34 profile**. The themes toward the top of your CliftonStrengths 34 profile might show up regularly in your life, and the ones closer to the bottom might not show up at all.

To fully understand your talent DNA, consider how all your CliftonStrengths themes, separately or in combination, influence your work and personal life. In addition to concentrating on your top 10 themes:

* **Navigate the middle**. You might notice these CliftonStrengths themes in your behaviors from time to time. And you may need to rely on them in certain situations. Think of these themes as a support system you can use when you need to.
* **Manage the bottom**. Just as your top CliftonStrengths show you who you are, those at the bottom may tell you who you are not. They aren’t necessarily weaknesses, but they are your least powerful themes. If you don’t manage them properly, they could prevent you from maximizing your potential.
* **Identify weaknesses**. To determine if any themes are getting in your way, review the “What Is a Weakness?” section on the next page, and find out how to overcome potential obstacles to your success.

To learn more about your entire CliftonStrengths profile, see the “Your CliftonStrengths 34 Theme Sequence” section at the end of the report.

<br>

## What Is a Weakness?

Focusing on your CliftonStrengths doesn’t mean you can ignore your weaknesses.

**Gallup defines a weakness as anything that gets in the way of your success**. While the CliftonStrengths assessment does not mathematically quantify weaknesses, you can use your profile to understand how any of your CliftonStrengths themes might prevent you from maximizing your potential.

Your strongest CliftonStrengths are your best opportunity for success. But in some situations and with some people, these same themes can hinder your effectiveness and become blind spots.

The themes at the bottom of your profile can also get in the way of your success. They aren’t necessarily weaknesses, but they likely do not come naturally to you.

**To identify potential weaknesses, ask yourself:**

* Does this theme ever undermine my success?
* Have I ever received negative feedback related to this theme?
* Does my role require me to use this theme, but I feel drained when I do?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may be discovering areas of weakness. Don’t ignore your weaknesses. Instead, focus on your strengths, and work to manage the areas that get in your way.

**How do I manage my weaknesses?**

* Claim them: Know your weaknesses and how they get in your way
* Collaborate: Ask partners for support
* Apply a strength: Use a different theme to achieve a better outcome
* Just do it: Lean in and do your best

<br>

## Identify Your Unique Contribution: The CliftonStrengths Domains

While your CliftonStrengths 34 profile helps you understand who you are, there is also power in knowing how you make things happen, influence others, build relationships and process information. The framework of the four CliftonStrengths domains — Executing, Influencing, Relationship Building and Strategic Thinking — is another way to think about your CliftonStrengths and how you contribute when you join, create or lead a team.

The best teams are made up of individuals who understand their own — and others’ — unique contribution to the team. This awareness and appreciation empowers the team to be more cohesive, versatile, productive and engaged.

However, be careful not to let the four domains limit your thinking. If you don’t have any top themes in a particular domain, don’t worry. That doesn’t mean you can’t think strategically or build relationships, for example. Everyone accomplishes tasks, influences others, builds relationships and processes information. You just use your stronger themes in different domains to get to the same outcome.

The next page shows you how your unique CliftonStrengths profile sorts into the four domains. Knowing which domain you lead with can help you understand your most powerful contribution.

<br>

### The CliftonStrengths Domains

**EXECUTING**: People with dominant Executing themes make things happen.

**INFLUENCING**: People with dominant Influencing themes take charge, speak up and make sure others are heard.

**RELATIONSHIP BUILDING**: People with dominant Relationship Building themes build strong relationships that hold a team together and make it greater than the sum of its parts.

**STRATEGIC THINKING**: People with dominant Strategic Thinking themes absorb and analyze information that informs better decisions.

<br>

### You lead with Strategic Thinking CliftonStrengths themes.

You know how to help individuals absorb and analyze information that can inform better decisions.

<br>

## Take Action

Discovering your CliftonStrengths is only the beginning. Achieving excellence depends on your ability to develop and apply your CliftonStrengths and maximize your potential.

Now, take the next steps:

* **Share your CliftonStrengths with others**. Conversations with those closest to you can accelerate your CliftonStrengths development.
