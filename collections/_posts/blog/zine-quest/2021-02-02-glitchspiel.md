*One is not born, but rather becomes, a body.*

*Glitchspiel* is a rules-free ttrpg zine in the free kriegsspiel style, expanding on my essay "Lovepunk" in the first issue of the FKR Collective's zine [*In Play*](https://inplay.itch.io/1).

In this text, I deploy [*Glitch Feminism*](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3668-glitch-feminism), Legacy Russell's manifesto, as a game, using her remarkable words as tactics for a transformative, reparative cyberpunk that cuts against both the norms of cyberpunk as a genre and the constraints of tabletop roleplaying as a form.

The project successfully funded on [*Kickstarter*](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vagrantludology/glitchspiel) on February 16 as part of [Zine Quest 3](https://www.kickstarter.com/zinequest), thanks to the generous support of 120 backers. I am also happy to report that because of the sucess of the campaign I was able to get additional copies printed, which can be purchased below.

*Usurp the body. Become your avatar. Be the glitch.*
