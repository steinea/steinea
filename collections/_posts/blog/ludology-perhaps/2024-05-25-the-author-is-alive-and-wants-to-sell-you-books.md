“The coming into being of the notion of the ‘author’ constitutes the privileged moment of individualization in the history of ideas, knowledge, literature, philosophy, and the sciences”

—Michel Foucault

This is an exquisite corpse ttrpg in which you and some friends explore the career of THE AUTHOR.

Version 0.1 is the ashcan edition.

If you are a millionaire, this game costs $50.00. Otherwise, take a community copy.

Many thanks to Momatoes, Franziska Trischler, Aaron Lim, Pam Punzalan, Thomas Manuel, and Jay Dragon for the excellent conversations that inspired this work.
