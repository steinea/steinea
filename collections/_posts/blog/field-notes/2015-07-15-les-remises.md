I would like to return to Hemingway once more, and I hope, in doing so, to demonstrate the importance of such, which is to say, the importance of *returning.* First, a quotation:

> But there are *remises* or storage places where you may leave or store certain things such as a locker trunk or duffel bag containing personal effects or the unpublished poems of Evan Shipman or marked maps or even weapons there was no time to over to the proper authorities and this book contains material from the *remises* of my memory and of my heart. Even if the one has been tampered with and the other does not exist.

As this final paragraph of the final sketch of Hemingway's *A Moveable Feast*,[^1] "Nada y Pues Nada," shows, Hemingway, too, is concerned with returning, with what he calls the *remises* of his memory and heart. These *remises* are, by his definition, "storage places," but here some etymological digging is warranted.

[*Remise*](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/remise#French) is the past participle of the French verb [*remettre*](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/remettre), to "put back" or "replace." As a noun, *une remise* is a "delivery" or "handing over," a "remission," a "reduction," a "shedding," a "deferment." In English, the word has been put to multiple uses, but most interestingly, a [*remise*](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/remise) in music is a "repetition or return of the opening material later in a composition," and in fencing a "renewal of a failed action, without withdrawing the arm." In law, to *remise* is to "surrender all interest in a property by executing a deed, to quitclaim \["relinquish, release, or transfer a title, claim, or interest to another"\]." And so, already, with a simple Wiktionary search, the connotative chain of Hemingway's word expands.

The Oxford English Dictionary is similarly [productive](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oed.com%2Fsearch%3FsearchType%3Ddictionary%26q%3Dremise%26_searchBtn%3DSearch&t=NTIyZDQ2MmY5OTY0ZjQxMGZjZGI5Mzc3ZTA2YWQ1ZmZiYWFkOTY1MCxmemF0Z1VyMg%3D%3D). Again, in law, a [*remise*](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oed.com%2Fview%2FEntry%2F162203%3Frskey%3DuamrxH%26result%3D1%26isAdvanced%3Dfalse%23eid&t=OGUzOWE1NmQ3NjBhMzU1NmU2NDU0ODc4MGQyZWM1YzExNjI2YmI2NyxmemF0Z1VyMg%3D%3D) is the "action of transferring or surrendering property, a right" or the "act of remitting money; a remittance." A [*remise*](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oed.com%2Fview%2FEntry%2F162204%3Frskey%3DuamrxH%26result%3D2%26isAdvanced%3Dfalse%23eid&t=OWJjNzJlNDAwYzEzYWZjZGI5MmZkMGI3M2NiNjU3NmZmM2UwZDlhYSxmemF0Z1VyMg%3D%3D) can also be a "building providing shelter for a carriage," or, as before, [in fencing](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oed.com%2Fview%2FEntry%2F274952%3Frskey%3DuamrxH%26result%3D4%26isAdvanced%3Dfalse%23eid&t=MGVlODVmYTgwYWUxMDM5ZjY5NDI3OGZhZjc1ZWZkMzg0MWUxNTU4MSxmemF0Z1VyMg%3D%3D), a "renewed attack made while still on the lunge, without returning to guard." As a verb, [*remise*](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oed.com%2Fview%2FEntry%2F162206%3Frskey%3DuamrxH%26result%3D5%26isAdvanced%3Dfalse%23eid&t=YjExMTliNmRiODhmNjUyYzU3Yjg4ZTc1NzIzZGUyMmFjMzYzMGMwNixmemF0Z1VyMg%3D%3D) can mean a number of things: to "give up, surrender, transfer, or release;" to "put back *in*," to "return *to*, replace," to "convert again *into*;" even, rarely, to "bring together again; to lead back again."

Taking the word in its connotative entirety, I find it interesting that the meaning Hemingway settles on for his English gloss of the French term is *shelter,* a "storage place." Ever literal, ever resisting the symbols that he, himself, creates, Hemingway's *remises* are places within himself in which he has stored all manners of things, as one stores "personal effects," and Evan Shipman's "unpublished poems," and "marked maps," and "weapons," and other "materials" in a "locker trunk or duffel bag."

But this is certainly not the only definition of the term Hemingway is aware of. As an *aficionado* of bullfighting, the *remise* as a fencing technique comes into play. As the writer of a memoir, Hemingway *returns* to his youth. In his apology to Hadley in "The Pilot Fish and the Rich" he makes *remittance,* while *deferring* his guilt into the second person and onto the reader. In the chapters on Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, and others, he *attacks* and *lunges*, verbally sparring. And in "Nada y Pues Nada" he *relinquishes* control and *sheds* (or at least tries to) the weight that he and all the other children of the "lost generation" bear. Hemingway leaves this out, these varied *remises*, as per his [principle](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4825/the-art-of-fiction-no-21-ernest-hemingway), concentrating instead on the material definition of the word as he experiences it. But, in writing *A Moveable Feast,* Hemingway opens up the "storage places" of his \"memory" and "heart" in a final attempt to make known the meanings he has locked away, to make known his *self*. In the process, he *transfers* the rights of his text, his life, to his readers. To read is to interpret, to engage with the [resonant field](/2015/07/14/reading-and-resonance) that all texts produce, that even single words like *remise* can produce. And so, to read *A Moveable Feast* is to read Hemingway, the man, not as an [author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author_function) or a [figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_figure) or a [type](http://sociologyindex.com/typification.htm), but as another being, another collection of potentialities, through whom our [projects and our freedoms](http://localhost:4000/2015/05/23/the-field-and-the-other) are made more fully known. This is what it is to *read*. It is our responsibility and our privilege.
