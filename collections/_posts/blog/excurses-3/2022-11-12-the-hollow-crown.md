I watched [The Hollow Crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollow_Crown_(TV_series)) telefilms of [*Henry IV, Part 1*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2120771/?ref_=ttep_ep2) and [*Henry IV, Part 2*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2120772/?ref_=ttep_ep3) tonight. Jeremy Irons and Tom Hiddleston are quite remarkable. The history plays were never taught in school, and I've not had the chance to read them. But I can feel the English major fire being stoked in me by these adaptations, and my fingers itch to order more books for the shelf.
