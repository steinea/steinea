I’m quite pleased to have gotten this HTML Journal up and running, and enjoying the more relaxed format to what I usually write. Checking in at The Neon Kiosk once a day is a pleasant little routine.

I need to get around to writing up a Now page, and then I’m going to try and get Webmentions working and use them for my longer [Notes](/blog). Maybe I’ll move to m15o’s [HTML Blog](https://blog.miso.town/) format too, though it will take a bit of fussing the way the posts are currently setup with Jekyll/Liquid. I’ll likely make this a part of a larger project to migrate the site off GitHub.

Finished my conference presentation for [Generation Analog](https://analoggamestudies.org/generation-analog-2022/) today: “Play to Lose: Animation, Failure, and the Milieu in Trophy Dark.” In it, I discuss my experience facilitating tabletop roleplaying games, and specifically Jesse Ross’s [*Trophy Dark*](https://trophyrpg.com/), for an undergraduate introduction to game design course at the university where I teach. Conference is online, and tickets are [free](https://www.game-in-lab.org/), if an analog game studies conference sounds interesting to you.
