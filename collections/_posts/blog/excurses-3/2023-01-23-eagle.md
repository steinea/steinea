One of the best parts of living in Sechelt is the bird population. Watching groups of [red-breasted mergansers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-breasted_merganser) diving for fish while I'm out on my walks is a delight. But most spectacular is the bald eagle that has taken up a perch in the gnarled tree that stands about fifty metres from my window, where it can survey the shallows of the inlet at a perfect angle. What a splendid distraction throughout my work day.
