A really excellent looking conference is happening this weekend at The Chan Centre for the Performing Arts on the UBC campus: [Games In Action: Interactivity / Activation \ Activism](https://gamesinaction.squarespace.com/). Very sad I can't attend. Lots of interesting panels and demos, and a pop-up arcade put on by [Heart Projector](http://heartprojector.com/) and the [UBC Emerging Media Lab](https://eml.ubc.ca/).
