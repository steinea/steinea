Artemis I has [finally](/2022/07/30/artemis) launched, and it was a sight to behold. "We rise together," the commentator said, and watching with all these other people around the world, seeing the overwhelming enthusiasm, joy, and fellowship in the chat, I felt that to be true. I remember the space shuttles from my younger years, but I don't have any memories of watching a launch as it happened. And there hasn't been a crewed moon landing in my lifetime, so knowing that this is the first mission in preparation for that to happen once again is thrilling. I watched the [full broadcast](Artemis I Launch to the Moon) on NASA's YouTube channel, but there is also a video of the [launch only](https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1592772202289430528) that can be seen at NASA's Twitter.
