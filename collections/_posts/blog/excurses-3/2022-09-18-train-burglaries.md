A break from physics and philosophy: how about some good ol’ heists? Specifically, train heists? Back in January, CBSLA reported the story “[Union Pacific: Train Robberies Up 356%](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/union-pacific-train-robberies-up-356-la-county-da-george-gascons-no-cash-bail-policy/),” and the images and videos are quite spectacular. Thousands of packages burgled from slow moving trains around Union Station, leaving the surrounding area positively smothered with cardboard detritus. Photojournalist [John Schreiber](https://twitter.com/johnschreiber) has an excellent [thread](https://twitter.com/johnschreiber/status/1481770722271760384) to accompany the article. To make matters worse, a train subsequently derailed in that very area, with footage and photos shared by photographer [Mike Ade Ojo](https://twitter.com/bellikemike) in [another thread](https://twitter.com/bellikemike/status/1482480779544256514).
