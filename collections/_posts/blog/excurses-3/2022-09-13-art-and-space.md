In 1979, Jean-Pierre Luminet published his paper “[Image of a Spherical Black Hole with Thin Accretion Disk](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234464726_Image_of_a_spherical_black_hole_with_thin_accretion_disk)” in *Astronomy and Astrophysics* in which he presented the world’s first simulated photograph of a black hole and its accretion disk. In 2019, the first real image of a black hole was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration and published in the paper “[Focus on the First Event Horizon Telescope Results](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205/page/Focus_on_EHT)” in *Astrophysical Journal Letters*. Luminet [remarked](https://www.cnrs.fr/en/first-ever-image-black-hole-cnrs-researcher-had-simulated-it-early-1979) on the striking continuity between the two images (and [other](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.11196) early computer simulations that followed), art prefiguring radio imagery by way of mathematics.

In 1953, Jackson Pollock painted *The Deep*, which hangs in the [Centre Pompidou](https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/ressources/oeuvre/cg9Kgy) today. In 2007, Olivier Michelon wrote of the painting: “The work resembles a cloud of brushed and poured milky paint, a cream mass in the center of which a slit discovers a matte black background accented with red. By approaching the atmospheric sensations of contemporary color-field painting, Jackson Pollock delivers with *The Deep* a vision that has remained singular in his career. Dug in the center of a torn nebula, this abyssal space still resonates, indicating an unexplored direction.”

In 2022, the [South African Radio Astronomy Observatory](https://www.sarao.ac.za/media-releases/new-meerkat-radio-image-reveals-complex-heart-of-the-milky-way/) released a MeerKAT radio telescope image of the galactic centre. What Michelon could not have known is that Pollock’s torn nebula somehow presaged this image—not simply a nebula but the heart of the galaxy itself, [radio bubbles](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1532-5?proof=t%2529) bursting from the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. A saturated abyss, an overflowing void. We can echo Hans-Georg Gadamer and say: the mode of being of nature is “[pure self-presentation](https://books.google.ca/books?id=SkdMAQAAQBAJ).”
