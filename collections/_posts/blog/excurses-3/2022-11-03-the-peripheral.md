[The Peripheral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peripheral_(TV_series)) is cool. Four episodes in as of today. I read quite a bit of William Gibson's work as a teenager, my dad's old mass market paperbacks, but haven't read any of his recent books. So far, the show is promising, and I hope it's doing the source material justice.
