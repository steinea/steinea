On a whim, I got *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind* up and running on my PC and spent the last few days playing through the opening zone of the game, [Seyda Neen](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Seyda_Neen). The last time I played Morrowind was shortly before *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion* came out, which was 2006. It's been a while. I own the game of the year addition through GOG, and most of the effort was put into getting it to display correctly on my 1440p monitor. Aurelie's [Wrye Mash Guide](https://danaeplays.thenet.sk/wrye-mash/) was extremely helpful. To summarize the process, you just need three pieces of software: the [Wrye Mash Polemos Fork](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45439), [MLOX](https://github.com/mlox/mlox/releases/tag/v1.0), and [tes3cmd](https://github.com/john-moonsugar/tes3cmd/releases/tag/v0.40-pre-release-2). Following the guide, I was able to easily install a few mods: the [Morrowind Code Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/19510), [Morrowind Graphics Extender XE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102), [Morrowind Enhanced Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46221), [UI Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46071), and [Better Dialogue Font](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/36873). Some of them install directly, and some through the Wrye Mash interface. Nothing too complicated. I didn't want to change the game dramatically, but rather just make it playable at higher resolution. So far, so good. I'm having a great time.
