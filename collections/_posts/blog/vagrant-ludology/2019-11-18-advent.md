*Advent* is a 200 word tabletop rpg originally written for and submitted to the 2019 [200 Word RPG Challenge](https://200wordrpg.github.io/). Following on my longer game, [*umbral / rhizome*](https://vagrantludology.itch.io/umbralrhizome), this game is another ludotheoretical text using philosophy as a vehicle for play, and play as a vehicle for philosophy.

Specifically, *Advent* uses the ideas of [Alain Badiou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Badiou) to construct what I term a "microhistoriographical" playspace, which is to say, a place at the table wherein you can explore with others what it means for a truth to emerge in history, radically transforming the terms of the situation, the participants in the situation, and the prior narratives that overdetermined the situation.

*Advent* can be played at home or in the classroom. It can take twenty minutes or several hours to play. It is, at bottom, a framework for thought.

The pdf version contains one minor change, a specification of the word "it" to "the event." The pdf version is still under 200 words, so I thought the change was appropriate. The uncorrected txt version is also included, which I originally submitted to the 200 Word RPG Challenge (which can be seen online [here](https://200wordrpg.github.io/2019/rpg/2019/10/04/Advent.html)).
