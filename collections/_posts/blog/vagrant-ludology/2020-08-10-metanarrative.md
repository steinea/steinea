Written for the [Unearthed Expansions Jam](https://itch.io/jam/unearthed-expansions), *Metanarrative* is not, primarily, an expansion for a game but an expansion for a book about games and the stories that we use games to tell. *Metanarrative* mechanizes Alexander Swords’ [Forest Paths Method](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B083ZPHJY2) while introducing to it a layer of randomness. As such, *Metanarrative* is a game about the making of game narratives (thus the name).

Play is one-on-one, gm-less, and story-focused. It only requires a deck of cards (including jokers) to play. *Metanarrative* utilizes the basic structure of *War*, but with a new set of mechanics layered on top. This makes *Metanarrative* a ttrpg expansion for *War* as much as it is for the Forest Paths Method.

This is very much a “version zero.” Feedback welcome!
