*Moonfall* is a story game about conviction, consequence, and transformation. It is inspired by [*Moon Hunters*](https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/moon-hunters) by Kitfox Games, [*Shooting the Moon*](http://www.blackgreengames.com/shop/romancetrilogypdf) by Emily Care Boss, and [*Trophy*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/268198/Codex--Dark-2-Dec-2018) by Jesse Ross, and hacks elements from each of these games. If you like Moonfall, please support these creators. *Moonfall* could not exist without their work.

The premise is simple: four warriors of the sun set out to kill the moon. Characterization and play are organized according to a system of traits, trials, and transformations. Progression occurs through dialogue and narration. There are no rolls for resolution.

The majority of this game was written on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Stó:lō people. As a settler living and working on this land, writing a game about conviction, consequence, and transformation, it is my responsibility to acknowledge this claim and add my voice to the work of decolonization.

*Moonfall* flows from the ideas in my [*Affinity*](https://vagrantludology.itch.io/affinity-dream) plugin and, as such, honours the principles of the [DREAM](https://itch.io/jam/dreamjam) movement. *Moonfall* is staunchly opposed to hate, prejudice, and harassment of all forms.
