*Among Farmers* is a work of tactical agriculture. It is a game to be played literally, ideologically, and affectionately. To play, our thought must be engaged concretely, materially, in everyday experience: in our bodies, in our worlds, and with our others.

A LARP, an RPG, a set of principles for direct action---*Among Farmers* takes its queues from a diverse array of sources. Errico Malatesta's [anarcho-communism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/errico-malatesta-between-peasants), Herman Melville's [*Billy Budd, Sailor*](https://mel-juxta-editions.herokuapp.com/documents/700), the [Green Armies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_armies) of the Russian Civil War, Robert Cover's [legal criticism](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/2705/), Wendell Berry's [land-community](https://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture/wendell-e-berry-biography), Avery Alder and Benjamin Rosenbaum's "[no dice, no masters](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/dream-askew)," and the economic critiques of racialized policing and incarceration from [Cedric Johnson](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/02/ta-nehisi-coates-case-for-reparations-bernie-sanders-racism/), [John Clegg and Adaner Usmani](https://catalyst-journal.com/vol3/no3/the-economic-origins-of-mass-incarceration), and [Dustin Guastella](https://nonsite.org/symposium/policing-symposium).

The game itself is ultra-minimal, formatted to fit on a single business-card. The accompanying essay provides the game with its theoretical framework and with sources for further reading. It is printable in both letter and half-letter zine format. To print the zine, select "booklet" and "both sides" in your print options.
