*Fear of Play* is an essay on nonsovereignty and games, presented here in a zine format. It was written for Adam Vass and Will Jobst's [Tech Jam](https://itch.io/jam/tech-jam) as a sort of cognitive plugin, in the spirit of my first ever game project, [*Affinity*](https://vagrantludology.itch.io/affinity-dream).

Using the work of David Graeber, Jean Baudrillard, Patrick Jagoda, Fred Moten, and Stefano Harney, *Fear of Play* tries to get around the issue of *sovereignty* and the violence it entails, both in the sphere of tabletop gaming and in the political sphere.

*Fear of Play* flows from my proposition of a gmless free kriegsspiel play style in my Zine Quest 3 project [*Glitchspiel*](https://vagrantludology.itch.io/glitchspiel) and from my study of nuclearity, ludology, and anarchy in "[From Governance to Planning](https://zenodo.org/record/4685025)."
