In advance of actually deploying my site to the web, I got Atom feeds set up today for my [Blog](/blog), [Commonplace](/collections/documents/commonplace), [Journal](/collections/documents/journal), and [Log](/about/log). I wanted to avoid using the jekyll-feed plugin, since I don't want to have the default unified feed, but rather only these four specific category-based feeds. Given the nature of the posts in each (and especially given the volume of posts in the Commonplace category), a unified feed doesn't make sense.

So, I returned to Jonathan McGlone's [guide](https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to get his atom.xml template. I updated the <code>{% raw %}{% for %}{% endraw %}</code> loop to <code>{% raw %}{% for post in site.categories.blog %}{% endraw %}</code> so that Jekyll will only build feeds for categories, and changed the layout variable to <code>layout: null</code> to remedy a build warning about the feed layout that doesn't effect sites built with GitHub pages, but does effect sites built locally, like mine.

I then created four distinct atom.xml files: [Blog](/blog/atom.xml), [Commonplace](/collections/documents/commonplace/atom.xml), [Journal](/collections/documents/journal/atom.xml), and [Log](/about/log/atom.xml). Now, visitors should be able to choose which of these feeds to subscribe to at will.
