It's been a journey folks. Since the [last entry](/2023/09/23/updates-and-fixes/) I've have been very busy on the site, but things have been in such a state of churn that I haven't bothered keeping up with changelogs.

The long and short of it is that I'm back on GitHub, though not using GitHub Pages. The repository is at <https://github.com/steinea/steinea/>, but I'm using Netlify to deploy, thanks to its many quality of life improvements over GitHub Pages.

For most of this year I was deploying from a [Sourcehut](https://builds.sr.ht/~steinea/) repository with Sourcehut Pages, but as much as I like the minimalism of the platform, I simply don't have the technical skills to make regular maintenance manageable. So back to GitHub I go.

I've at last branched out to a new layout and styling, with all credit to [Nicky Flowers](https://nickyflowers.com/) for the CSS tricks.

Where in the past I've started by migrating over all my content, this time I've been careful to start by building out the site structure first. With that (mostly) done, I'm now starting to pull over some content to test that structure, starting here with the changelog.
