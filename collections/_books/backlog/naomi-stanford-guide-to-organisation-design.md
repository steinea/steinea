### Abstract

> "Organisation design is how people and work are organised to carry out an organisation's strategy and achieve its aims. It matters. Thousands of established businesses fail every year because of the way they are organised or reorganised. Quite simply, survival can depend on whether a business has structures and reporting lines that both meet the needs of the market and are able to adapt to a rapidly changing business environment. Yet managers seldom talk coherently about structuring or restructuring their operations, let alone take a systematic approach. Too often, organisations are restructured for the wrong reasons and without taking fully into account the implications of what they are attempting to achieve. This revised and updated Economist guide shows how leaders should think about and implement the design of a company, using six easy-to-use guiding principles for effective and reflective organisation design which is properly aligned with strategy and operating context."
