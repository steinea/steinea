## Hello, world üëã

Welcome to the repository for my personal site. I am a game [producer](https://linkedin.com/in/steinea/ "LinkedIn"), [publisher](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/vagrantludology/created "Kickstarter"), [designer](https://steinea.itch.io/ "itch.io"), and [researcher](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4131-2695 "ORCID"), located in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia. I work and live on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the St√≥Íûâl≈ç, Mathxw√≠, Sem√°:th, and Kwantlen First Nations. This website is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/ "Maggie Appleton"), my [memex](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/about.html "Devine Lu Linvega"), or perhaps most apt, given my interests, my [thought cabinet](https://discoelysium.fandom.com/wiki/Thought_Cabinet "Disco Elysium").
